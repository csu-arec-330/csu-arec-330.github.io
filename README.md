# AREC 330 

This repository contains course content for AREC 330 and the AREC 330 course webpage. The course webpage is https://csu-arec-330.github.io.

The webpage is adapted from Steve's No-Good-Very-Bad Course Website Jekyll Template. This template is a Jekyll template, patterned entirely off my no-good-very-bad Jekyll Template at [svmiller.com](http://svmiller.com), for organizing a course website. I should note that because I ganked it from my website template, there's a lot of empty tags in the template that make reference to things that don't appear in the main `.yml` file. In other words, they reference things that should be there but, because they're not there, ultimately won't interfere with how the site renders.

The repo for the website template is: https://github.com/svmiller/course-website.

## Directory Structure

The AREC 330 course materials are located in the directory "materials". This repository is organized around four units.  Each unit contains subdirectories for lectures, assignments, labs, and any other materials. 

There are also a variety of folders for website materials.
