<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-description-and-objectives">Course Description and Objectives</h2>
<p>The world generates <a href="https://financesonline.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#:~:text=Every%20day%20Big%20Data%20statistics,(2021%2C%20February%209).">2.5 quintillion bytes</a> of data each day. One of the key modern business challenges is transforming that data into actionable insights that improve decision making (i.e., data-driven decision making). Transforming data into information is not magic. It requires understanding the decision problem, organizing and processing data, analyzing data, and finally presenting information. This course will introduce you to this process of transforming data into actionable insights and build a core set of competencies with two commonly used software: R and Tableau. Since we only have 16 weeks, the most important lesson you will learn in this class is how to teach yourself what you need to know in the future. You will learn these skills by completing the three group projects over the semester.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-materials" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<p>All course materials are freely available on the course website: . There is no single textbook that you need to purchase. Course deliverables will be submitted on Canvas unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>The course will require the use of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R (statistical computing software)</a> and <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau (business intelligence software)</a>. R is an open source platform free to anyone. Tableau is freely available to you while you are a student at CSU. You will need to use these tools outside of class, so we recommend installing them on your own computer. Otherwise, it will be your responsibility to use the computer labs outside of class to complete assignments.</p>
<p>We will use iClicker software to take attendance at lecture and assess understanding of the material. If you have not already joined the course, you can do so using this link: <a href="https://join.iclicker.com/BIDY" class="uri">https://join.iclicker.com/BIDY</a></p>
</section>
<section id="course-structure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p><strong>Projects</strong> The course is organized into four projects intended to develop different analytical skills. The projects will be completed in teams. The project in each unit will be completed in parts. The parts will be submitted as weekly assignments. However, the final project deliverable will be worth the majority of points.</p>
<p><strong>Teams</strong> Many careers require teamwork in some form. In this course, you will work in teams to complete your assignments and present your work. Team projects will train students to collaborate with peers as they likely will do in the workplace. Group work can also lead to freeriding so, students will evaluate themselves and each other after each project. The evaluation will provide the students the opportunity to explain their contribution and those of their peers. The instructors will be available to resolve disputes within a team. However, the most productive arrangement for this class (and in your future workplace) is to communicate expectations with your colleagues and do your part of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Website</strong> Students will create a website that will serve as a repository for projects/assignments. If this is your first time creating a website, we recommend <a href="https://sites.google.com">google sites</a> - a free and easy to use website editing and hosting tool. It will also serve as a record of their work in a presentable format that can be shared within or outside of CSU. <em>There are many other tools for building and hosting websites. Please come talk to us if you have another option in mind or would like learn a more advanced option.</em></p>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong> There will be quizzes approximately every two weeks. The quizzes will be administered on Canvas and cover topics ranging from data processing to graphical presentation of information.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance and Participation</strong> There will be iClicker questions incorporated into most lecture materials. These questions are intended to test understanding of lecture materials and provide the instructors with real-time feedback on comprehension. Responses will account for a small portion of the overall course grade.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-expectations-and-policies" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-expectations-and-policies">Course Expectations and Policies</h2>
<p>We will communicate with you through your CSU email (<span class="citation" data-cites="rams.colostate.edu">@rams.colostate.edu</span>) and through Canvas. Email is the best way to reach us. When many students have the same kind of question, we may reply to the entire class or post documents on the class website.</p>
<p>During class, please turn off your cell phones and put them away. Be respectful of each other and your instructors/TA. Much of the course content will require the use of computers. Please use laptops and lab computers appropriately (do not watch media in class).</p>

<section id="sexual-assault-and-violence-elimination" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sexual-assault-and-violence-elimination">Sexual Assault and Violence Elimination</h2>
<p>CSU’s Student Sexual Harassment and Violence policy, following national guidance from the Office of Civil Rights, requires that professors follow CSU policy as a “mandatory reporter” of any personal disclosure of sexual harassment, abuse, and/or violence related experiences or incidents shared with the professor in person, via email, and/or in classroom papers or homework exercises. These disclosures include but are not limited to reports of personal relational abuse, relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While professors are often able to help students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus (e.g., see the CSU Health Network link below), disclosure by the student to the professor requires that the professor inform appropriate CSU channels to help ensure that the student’s safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student requests that the disclosure not be shared.</p>
<p>For counseling support and assistance, please see The CSU HEALTH NETWORK, which includes a variety of counseling services that can be accessed at: http://www.health.colostate.edu/. And, The Sexual Assault Victim Assistance Team is a confidential resource for students that does not have a reporting requirement and that can be of great help to students who have experienced sexual assault. The web address is http://www.wgac.colostate.edu/need-help-support.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic misconduct (see examples below) undermines the educational experience at Colorado State University, lowers morale by engendering a skeptical attitude about the quality of education, and negatively affects the relationship between students and faculty/instructors.</p>
<p>Faculty/Instructors are expected to use reasonably practical means of preventing and detecting academic misconduct. Any student found responsible for having engaged in academic misconduct will be subject to academic penalty and/or University disciplinary action.</p>

You may use the tool as a coding assistant to solve problems and help you understand the software used in the course</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Plagiarism – Plagiarism includes the copying of language, structure, images, ideas, or thoughts of another, and representing them as one’s own without proper acknowledgment, and is related only to work submitted for credit. Also included is the failure to cite sources properly; sources must always be appropriately referenced, whether the source is printed, electronic or spoken.</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized Possession or Disposition of Academic Materials – Unauthorized possession or disposition of academic materials includes the unauthorized selling or purchasing of examinations, term papers, or other academic work; stealing another student’s work; and using information from or possessing exams that an instructor did not authorize for release to students.</p></li>
