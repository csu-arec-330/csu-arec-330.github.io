# Intro to Linear Regressions

# 
::: {.r-fit-text }
**The objective:** <br>
We want to understand the <br> 
relationship between two variables
:::
#

::: {.r-fit-text }
**The simple solution:** <br> 
Assume the relationship is linear <br> 
and estimate the "average" trend

## Linear regression: The intuition {.scrollable}

How could we use these data to answer:

1.  Are carrot prices, on average, increasing or decreasing?

2.  How much do observed carrot prices deviate from the average trend?

3.  What is the most reasonable prediction of carrot prices 250 months after the financial crisis?

## Exercise 1: Which trend line is best?

## The Ordinary Least Squares Regression 

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the most common estimation method for linear models.

For a good reason: 

As long as your model satisfies the OLS assumptions you're getting the BEST possible estimates.

BEST = accurate (unbiased) + most precise (best)

Tableau, Excel, and other programs use OLS to estimate trend lines.

## OLS: Unbiased {.scrollable}

What do we mean by "unbiased"?

- predictions are correct on average

- the average value of errors (the distance between observations and predictions) equals zero

## OLS: Best {.scrollable}

What do we mean by "best"?

- predictions have the smallest possible variance

- larger variance = larger probability that our estimates are further away from the correct/true/observed value

## OLS: Equation

![](includes/reg_eq.png){width="100%"}

## OLS: Estimation

**Problem:** 

We need to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ using observed values of $Y_i$ and $X_i$

**Solution:** 

$$
\widehat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i-\bar{Y}\right)\left(X_i-\bar{X}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n\left( X_i-\bar{X} \right)^2}\cdot \bar{X}
$$

$$
\widehat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i-\bar{Y}\right)\left(X_i-\bar{X}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n\left( X_i-\bar{X} \right)^2}
$$

## OLS: Interpretting Tableau output

## Q: What is our "Y" variable?

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}


A. `months_since_crisis`

B. `0.0728323`

C. `Avg. Carrot price`

D. `189.513`

## Q: What is our "X" variable?

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}

A. `months_since_crisis`

B. `0.0728323`

C. `Avg. Carrot price`

D. `189.513`


## Q: What is our estimate of $\beta_0$?

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}


A. `months_since_crisis`

B. `0.0728323`

C. `Avg. Carrot price`

D. `189.513`

## Q: What is our estimate of $\beta_1$?

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}

A. `months_since_crisis`

B. `0.0728323`

C. `Avg. Carrot price`

D. `189.513`

## Discussion: Interpretting Tableau output

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i
$$

What is does $\beta_0$ represent? How can we interpret it? What does it mean for how the trend line will appear in our visualization?

$$

## Interpretting Tableau output: What is $R^2$?

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}

- A statistical measure of "fit"

- It tells us how much variation of the $Y$ variable is explained by the $X$ variable(s)

- Higher $R^2$ =  better fit; $R^2$ = 1 $\Rightarrow$ all variation is explained; [More info](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/statistics/regression-and-correlation/coefficient-of-determination-r-squared.html)

![](includes/r_sq.png){width="100%"}

## Interpretting output: What is P-value?

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}

- Tableau's default P-value is a measure of the significance for slope parameter $\beta_1$

- smaller p-value = better 

- A p-value of 0.05 or less is often considered statistically significant $\Rightarrow$ statistically significantly different from 0; [More info](https://www.w3schools.com/datascience/ds_linear_regression_pvalue.asp)

## Interpretting: What is P-value?

Note that clicking "describe trend line" will also give you a p-value for the intercept parameter.

## Q: How well does the model fit the data?

![](includes/exercise.png){width="100%"}


A. Extremely well

B. Decent

C. Not well

## Q: How confident are you that the estimated slope is different from zero?

![](includes/exercise.png){width="100%"}


A. Very

B. Somewhat

C. Not at all

## Using OLS regressions to forecast

**How?**

- Continue/extend your trend beyond your time series

- Tableau and other programs can do this for you automatically

- You can also do this manually by plugging in values of your $X$ variable(s)...

## Using OLS regressions to forecast

**What is the most reasonable prediction of carrot prices 250 months after the financial crisis?**

![](includes/tableau_reg.png){width="100%"}

$$
\hat{Y} = 189.513 + 0.0728323*(250) = 207.721
$$

## Cautionary note 

- We will teach you enough to be dangerous

- We are introducing you to the tip of the analytical iceberg.  Learn more before you put this into practice.

- Incorrect analysis can lead to worse conclusions than no analysis

::: {.incremental}

- Be wary of causal conclusions!
