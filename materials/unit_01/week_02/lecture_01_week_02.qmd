# Time Series Decomposition

## Why decompose a time series?

Time series data often contain patterns that we can break down into
different components.

**Decomposition** allows us to separate these components to better
understand underlying trends and improve forecasting.

## Components of Time Series

Recall that a time series is often composed of:

1.  **Trend (T)** – The long-term pattern of increase or decrease.
2.  **Seasonality (S)** – Regularly repeating patterns over time.
3.  **Residual (R)** – Random noise or unexplained variation.

## Example: Why Decomposition Matters {.scrollable}

Consider monthly **egg prices** over several years. Prices fluctuate due
to multiple factors:

-   A long-term **trend**: We expect a gradual increase in price.
-   A **seasonal pattern**: We expect prices rise before holidays and drop
    afterward.
-   **Random variations**: We expect random market disruptions or supply chain issues to affect prices.

By decomposing the time series, we can isolate these effects and make better predictions.

# Example: Egg Price Decomposition

##  {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyquant)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)

# Retrieve time series data
egg_data <- tq_get("APU0000708111", get = "economic.data", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2024-02-28")

# Convert to time series object
egg_ts <- ts(egg_data$price, start = c(2010, 1), frequency = 12)

# Apply decomposition
egg_decomp <- decompose(egg_ts, type = "multiplicative")

# Plot decomposition
plot(egg_decomp)
```
This plot helps us:

-   Identify long-term trends in egg prices.
-   Recognize seasonal price spikes.
-   Spot unexpected deviations that might indicate market disruptions.


## How Decomposition Works

We assume that a time series can be expressed as either an **additive**
or **multiplicative** model.

The outcome we are modeling is the observed value of a time series at a specific point in time.

## Additive Model (when variations remain constant) {.scrollable}

$Y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t$

Where:

- $Y_t$ is the recorded data at a given time
- $T_t$ is the trend component
- $S_t$ is the seasonal component
- $R_t$ is the random component

Decomposition helps us break down the value of $Y_t$ into meaningful components.

## Example: Additive Model

Suppose we analyze monthly sales of a product: 

- Sales have been increasing by **\$1,000** per month. 
- A **holiday effect** adds **\$500** in December and subtracts **\$300** in January. 
- Random variations range between **-\$200** and **\$200**.

**Question:** If the baseline sales in January 2023 were **\$10,000**, what would the expected sales be in **December 2023**? 

## Example: Additive Model {.scrollable}

Using the given trend and seasonal components, we can write our time series decomposition as:

$Y_{Dec} = 10,000 + (1,000 \times 11) + 500 + R$

:::{.incremental}
- $10,000 is the baseline sales in January 2023. *This is included because it is the initial sales before any trend, seasonal, or random effects are applied.*
- ($1,000 \times 11$) is the increase of $1,000 per month for 11 months (from February to December). *This is the trend accumulation.*
- 500 is a holiday seasonal effect that increases sales in December. *This is the seasonal effect for December.*
- $R$ is a random variation (which we assume is 0 for now).
:::
. . .

**Answer:** $Y_{Dec} = \$21,500$

## Egg Example: Revisited (Additive Model)
```{r}
#| eval: true

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyquant)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)

# Retrieve time series data
egg_data <- tq_get("APU0000708111", get = "economic.data", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2024-02-28")

# Convert to time series object
egg_ts <- ts(egg_data$price, start = c(2010, 1), frequency = 12)

# Apply decomposition
egg_decomp_add <- decompose(egg_ts, type = "additive")

# Plot decomposition
plot(egg_decomp_add)
```

## Multiplicative Model (when variations scale with the trend level) {.scrollable}

$Y_t = T_t \times S_t \times R_t$

Where:

- $Y_t$ is the recorded data at a given time
- $T_t$ is the trend component
- $S_t$ is the seasonal component
- $R_t$ is the random component

The multiplicative model is often used when seasonality effects **increase proportionally** with the trend.

## Example: Multiplicative Model

Suppose a company’s revenue...

- grows **5% each month** (trend), and 
- there is a **seasonal multiplier** of **1.2** in December and **0.9** in January.

**Question:** If the baseline revenue in January 2023 was **\$10,000**, what would the expected revenue be in **December 2023**? 

## Example: Multiplicative Model {.scrollable}

Using the given trend and seasonal components, we can write our time series decomposition as:

$Y_{Dec} = (10,000 \times 1.05^{11}) \times 1.2 \times R$

:::{.incremental}
- $10,000 is the baseline sales in January 2023. *This is included because it is the initial sales before any trend, seasonal, or random effects are applied.*
- ($1.05^{11}$) represents the compounded growth over 11 months. *Each month, the revenue increases by 5%, so we apply this growth rate cumulatively.*
- 1.2 is the seasonal effect for December. *December sees a 20% increase due to seasonality.*
- $R$ is a random variation (which we assume is 1 for now).
:::
. . .

**Answer:** $Y_{Dec} = \$20,524.07$

## Egg Example: Revisited (Multiplicative Model)
```{r}
#| eval: true

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyquant)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)

# Retrieve time series data
egg_data <- tq_get("APU0000708111", get = "economic.data", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2024-02-28")

# Convert to time series object
egg_ts <- ts(egg_data$price, start = c(2010, 1), frequency = 12)

# Apply decomposition
egg_decomp_mult <- decompose(egg_ts, type = "multiplicative")

# Plot decomposition
plot(egg_decomp_mult)
```

## Egg Example: Revisited (Takeaways)

Additive versus Multiplicative?

- If egg prices increase over time due to inflation or demand shifts, seasonal peaks and troughs will likely **grow proportionally** rather than stay constant. A multiplicative model would be more appropriate.

- If the seasonal effect **remained constant** over time, an additive model would be more appropriate.

## Interpreting the Results

-   **Trend Component**: The overall direction of the data (upward/downward).
-   **Seasonal Component**: Repeating patterns within a year.
-   **Random/Residual Component**: What remains after removing trend and seasonality.

## Using `decompose()` in R {.scrollable}

Now that we understand the components of a time series, how do we extract them from real-world data? 

In this week's lab, we will use R's `decompose()` function to break down a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components.

## Discussion Questions (Partner Activity):

1. In pairs, choose a time series from your group project.
2. Think about what question you want to answer with your data.
  - Which time series dataset would be most useful for your group's research question?
  - How would time series decomposition help you analyze the dataset to answer your question?

When choosing your time series data for the project, consider the type of **decision-makers** who would benefit from your analysis. 

## Here is a scenario to help guide your choice

**Context:** Suppose you are advising a **grain processing company** that wants to maintain a stable supply of raw materials for the next five years. 

**Decision To-Be-Made:** They need to decide **which grain (corn, wheat, or soybeans) to invest in** based on future price trends.

## Possible time series choices {.scrollable}

1. **Historical Corn Prices (Monthly, FRED Database)**
   - Used to track long-term price trends and forecast future prices.
   - Helps the company decide if corn is a stable and profitable investment.
   
2. **Soybean Export Volumes (USDA Reports, Quarterly)**
   - Can indicate global demand trends and potential supply chain risks.
   - Helps in assessing whether soybeans will remain a competitive option.
   
3. **Wheat Production Forecasts (FAO, Annual Reports)**
   - Provides data on expected future supply based on weather and policy conditions.
   - Helps the company determine if wheat will face shortages or surpluses in the coming years.

## Recap

-   Decomposition separates time series into **trend, seasonality, and residuals**.
-   Understanding these components improves forecasting accuracy.
-   Discuss how these insights apply to your group project.

**Next:** Implement decomposition in this week's lab!
