# Before you begin

1. Create a new sub-folder called `lab_05` under your `arec_330` folder.

- This is the folder where you will save all of the files we will download during this lab.

2. Open a new R script and save it as `lab_05_script.R`.

3. Add a description of the script as a comment.

4. Set your working directory as `arec_330/lab_05`.

5. Load (install if necessary) needed packages.


# Time series with R

The overall objective of this lab is to acquaint you with **time series data.**

Time series data is widely used but lacks a standardized format. Importantly, dates and times are not inherently understood by machines—they are stored as numbers relative to a specific starting point (epoch).^[https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/57052/how-to-convert-unix-epoch-time-values-in.html#:~:text=Epoch%20%2F%20UNIX%20time%20is%20the,on%20the%2070%20years%20difference.]

- **R Epoch:** January 1, 1970
- **Excel Epoch:** January 1, 1900

You can confirm this by running:
```{r}
#| eval: true

#epoch
as.numeric(as.Date("1970-01-01"))

#add one day to see how dates are tracked
as.numeric(as.Date("1970-01-02"))
```

## Importing time series data

Importing time series data is similar to other types of data, but special attention is needed for date formatting.

We will use [**retail egg price data** from the St. Louis FED (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111). 

You can download the data manually or import it directly via `read_csv()`:
```{r}
#| eval: true

#Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

#Read in the data
egg_raw <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_01/inputs/APU0000708111.csv")

```

The `read_csv()` function will try to guess the data type. In this case, it correctly identifies the variable `DATE` as a date. 

Review the data type of the variable directly by looking at the dataframe:
```{r}
#| eval: true

#Confirm that R read in the date field as a date
glimpse(egg_raw)
```

## Handling dates in R

Sometimes, date fields are stored as **text** and need to be converted. In these cases, you need to give R some guidance.

To see this in practice, read in a [modified version of the egg prices data](https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_01/inputs/APU0000708111_cdate.csv).

Assign the dataframe to an object called `egg_raw_c` to avoid overwriting the existing data:

```{r}
#| eval: true

#Read in the data
egg_raw_c <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_01/inputs/APU0000708111_cdate.csv")

#Confirm that R read in the date field as text and *not* a date
glimpse(egg_raw_c)
```

Notice that the date is not recognized as a date type variable. **You can verify this because `CHAR_DATE` is listed as `chr (1)`.**

Next, we need to tell R how to interpret that date. We will use functions from the `tidyverse` package, specifically the [`lubridate` library](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/index.html), designed to help work with dates. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

# The easiest way to get lubridate is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just lubridate:
install.packages("lubridate")

#Load the necessary libraries
library(lubridate)

#Use the mutate() function along with the mdy() function to convert the text date to a date value
egg_raw_c <- mutate(egg_raw_c,measure_date=mdy(CHAR_DATE))

#Confirm that you have successfully converted the variable to a date field
glimpse(egg_raw_c)
```

Alternatively, you can chain commands:

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Chaining commands to produce the same data frame
egg_raw_c %>%
  mutate(measure_date=mdy(CHAR_DATE)) %>%
  glimpse()
```

### Video: Reading in Time Series Data

{{< video https://youtu.be/zpTNJyiPiwE aspect-ratio="16x9" >}}

## Accessing data via API

API stands for **Application Programming Interface** and they facilitate much of the communication across the modern web.   

![API schematic. Source: https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/](https://content.altexsoft.com/media/2019/06/1.png)

We use APIs to query data. FRED maintains an API that can be accessed using the library [`tidyquant`](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/). This library also has a large array of finance analysis tools.  Right now, we will just use it to access FRED data.  


### Retrieving data via an API

The API we will use retrieves data from the FRED. Specifically, we will retrieve price series data, [available here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32455). 

#### Before you begin

Before you begin, explore the FRED website.

1. Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32455. What do you see?

2. Select **Commodities.**

3. Use the **Filter by** navigation bar to filter concepts. Select **Retail**. What changes?

4. The default list of tables is sorted by popularity. Currently, the average price of eggs is the most popular. Select that table.

Now, let's deconstruct the image you see.

![](includes/egg_series.png){width="80%"}

1. This is the unique identifier from FRED that is specific to the data series.

2. This is the date range underlying the data series.

3. This is the actual data series, not seasonally adjusted.

Now that we are familiar with this layout, let's use an API to retreive the data and save it as a data frame in R.

#### Step 1: Install and load libraries

Install `tidyquant` on your machine (e.g., `install.packages("tidyquant")`) and load the library.

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Install the package if you have not already done so. Comment this out after you have installed it once on your machine.
install.packages("tidyquant")

#Load the library. The library needs to be loaded every time you begin a new instance of R.
library(tidyquant, quietly = TRUE) #Note: The argument quietly = T in the library() function suppresses messages that would normally be printed when loading a package.
```


#### Step 2: Retrieve time series data via `tq_get()`

For this exercise, we will use the function `tq_get()` to access the FRED API. 

:::{.callout-note title="Understanding `tq_get()` Syntax" collapse=true}

The `tq_get()` function is used to retrieve time series data from sources such as FRED, stock prices, and exchange rates.

```{r}
#| eval: false
data <- tq_get("symbol", 
               get = "data_source", 
               from = "YYYY-MM-DD", 
               to = "YYYY-MM-DD")
```

- "symbol" $\rightarrow$ The unique identifier for the data series (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple stock, "GDP" for U.S. GDP from FRED).
- `get` $\rightarrow$ The data source, such as:
  - "economic.data" for macroeconomic data from FRED.
  - "stock.prices" for historical stock prices.
  - "dividends" for dividend data.
  - "exchange.rates" for currency exchange rates.
- `from` and `to` $\rightarrow$ Defines the date range for the retrieved data in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- `data` $\rightarrow$ The resulting dataframe containing the retrieved time series.

:::

This function can do many things so we need to be specific with some parameters:

- First, we need to find the unique identifier from FRED that points to the data we want. In this case, we are going to grab **retail egg prices** (the same data that we downloaded earlier). The unique identifier is `"APU0000708111"`. **Remember the quotes.**

- Second, the documentation tells us that to access data from FRED we need to set the `get` parameter to `"economic.data"`.

- Third, we can specify the date range with the `from` and `to` parameters.  Remember to use the YYYY-MM-DD format.

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Use the tq_get() function to retrieve the time series data
egg_raw_tq <- tq_get("APU0000708111", # This is the symbol for retail egg prices
                     get = "economic.data", # This is the data source
                     from="1990-01-01", # This is the start of our time range
                     to="2024-02-28") # This is the end of our time range

glimpse(egg_raw_tq)
```


#### Step 3: Retrieve multiple time series data using `tq_get()`

You can download multiple time series at once by using a vector of identifiers. 

Let's download the **producer price index** to compare to the retail price of a dozen eggs.  The identifier is `WPU017107`.  Note that I am going to overwrite the existing object `egg_raw_tq` because I am going to download the retail price series as well as the producer price index.

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Use the tq_get() function to retrieve two time series datasets
egg_raw_tq <- tq_get(c("APU0000708111","WPU017107"),
                     get = "economic.data",
                     from="1990-01-01",
                     to="2024-02-28")

glimpse(egg_raw_tq)
```

:::{.callout-important title="Using `c()` to Retrieve Multiple Series"}

When retrieving multiple time series, use `c()` to pass multiple symbols into `tq_get()`. What this code does is:

- `c("APU0000708111", "WPU017107")` $\rightarrow$ A vector containing multiple FRED series.
- This retrieves both retail egg prices (APU0000708111) and the producer price index for eggs (WPU017107).
- The resulting dataframe will contain stacked time series, with an identifier column (symbol) to distinguish them.

:::

#### Step 4: Rename variables for clarity

Notice that there are **3 columns** in **egg_raw_tq** but we downloaded two time series. Why aren't there **4 columns**?  

**Answer:** The new data is stacked.  We can confirm this a few ways:

1. Use the `unique()` function to see what values for symbol are in the dataset
```{r}
#| eval: false

#Display the unique values of the variable symbol
unique(egg_raw_tq$symbol)
```

2. Use `table()` to see the counts by each value
```{r}
#| eval: false

#Count the number of observations associated with each value of symbol
table(egg_raw_tq$symbol)
```

>Why does the retail series `APU0000708111` have more observations?

3. Use `case_when()` to replacing values based on a criteria

The time series are currently identified by the variable `symbol`.  These codes are not informative.  Let's replace them with better labels.  

We will use the `case_when()` function in the `dplyr` package to replace the symbol with a more descriptive name.
```{r}
#| eval: false

#Use the FRED API to retrieve two data series and rename them the series with a more descriptive name
egg_out <- egg_raw_tq %>%
  mutate(description=case_when(
    symbol == "APU0000708111" ~ "Egg Retail Price", #if symbol equals APU0000708111, then replace value with Egg Retail Price
    symbol == "WPU017107" ~ "Egg Producer Price" #if symbol equals WPU017107, then replace value with Egg Producer Price
  ))
```

4. Use `write_csv()` to write the dataset to a csv file.

Now the dataset is ready for export in .csv format so you can import it into Tableau.
```{r}
#| eval: false

#Write the dataset to a csv file
write_csv(egg_prices, "egg_prices.csv")
```

:::{.callout-note title="You do it"}

1. Download the following data series using `tq_get()` as **separate data frames**:

- Producer Price Index: Carrots, symbol = "WPU01130212"
- Producer Price Index: Tomatoes, symbol = "WPU01130217"
- Producer Price Index: Corn, symbol = "WPS012202"

2. Rename the symbols to a more descriptive name.

- Carrot Producer Price
- Tomato Producer Price
- Corn Producer Price

3. Write each data frame as separate csv files:

- carrot_prices.csv
- tomato_prices.csv
- corn_prices.csv

# Tableau

A key attribute of time series data is that we observe values of variables across **time**. Effective analysis of time series data in Tableau thus begins with understanding date variables and functions. Next, we want to understand what visualizations are most appropriate for time series analysis. Finally we want to understand how to make these visualizations as effective as possible.  

### Before you begin

Connect to the folder where you have saved `carrot_prices.csv`, and the three other commodity price series data.

### 1. Date functions

Date functions are Tableau functions that use a date or a date-time field in some way, whether it’s part of the input to perform the calculation or whether the output is a date-time field. Let’s learn about different date functions, their expressions, and their use in Tableau.

You can explore these functions by going to `Create calculated field` (drop down menu in the data field pane). You can filter on date functions by choosing `Date` from the library of functions. This will list only the functions that are classified as Date functions.

You can look through these on your own, but I will highlight a few here.

-  DATEPART (date_part, date, [start_of_week]) returns part of a given date as a number. 

    > For example, DATEPART (‘month’, #January 23, 2021#) = 1. Note the hashtags

- DATENAME (date_part, date, [start_of_week]) is similar to DATEPART, but it returns part of a given date as a string.

    > For example, DATENAME (‘month’, #January 23, 2021#) = January

- DATEADD (date_part, increment, date) returns a date in which the specified increment has been added to the given date.

    > For example, DATEADD (‘day’, 7, #January 23, 2021#) = January 30, 2021

- DATEDIFF (date_part, start_date, end_date, [start_of_week]) returns the difference between the two dates using the specified date part. 

    > For example, DATEDIFF ('day', #January 23, 2021#, #February 24, 2021#) = 32              and DATEDIFF ('month', #January 23, 2021#, #February 24, 2021#) = 1

- DATETRUNC (date_part, date, [start_of_week]) truncates or “rounds down” the given date to the level of the specified date_part. This function returns a new date. 

    > For example, when you truncate a date that is in the middle of the month at the month level, this function returns the first day of the month. So DATETRUNC (‘month’, #January 23, 2021#) returns January 1, 2021. 
                
- MIN (expression) returns the earliest date across all records, and MIN (expression 1, expression 2) returns the earlier of the two dates for each record. 

    > For example, MIN ([Order Date]) returns the earliest date in the Order Date field.

- MAX (expression) returns the latest date across all records, and MAX (expression 1, expression 2) returns the earlier of the two dates for each record. 

    > For example, MAX ([Order Date]) returns the latest date in the Order Date field.

Here are some handy definitions for date_time arguments:

![](includes/date_args.png)

:::{.callout-note title="You do it"}

1. Create a calculated field named `months_ago` that determines the number of months between the commodity price data and today.

2. Create a calculated field named `first_date` that determines the earliest date in the data.

3. Create a calculated field named `last_date` that determines the last date that the carrot price index was less than 135.

4. Create a new variable called `month` that only includes the month.

5. Create a new variable called `year` that only includes the year.

6. Create a new date variable called `my_date` that assigns a new date using your `month` and `year` variables and sets the day as 15.

:::

### 2. Visualize time series data

What types of visualizations are most appropriate for time series data?  

-  Line graphs

-  Bar charts  

-  Dot plots

-  Others?

Let's experiment with creating these visualizations for time series:  

1.  Create a line graph that shows the value of carrots over time (by month)

2.  Add markers to your line graph

3.  Change your line graph to a bar graph dot chart

4.  Change your bar graph to a dot plot

5.  Change the size, colors, and opacity of the dots in your dot plot (use the `Size` and `Color` icons)

6.  Change the markers in your chart from dots to a different shape (use the drop down menu on the `Marks` card, then use the `Shape` icons)

#### Modifying Data Display in Charts
Now let's experiment with changing what data is shown in your chart:  

1.  Change your x-axis to annual

2.  Create one line that shows the average value of the commodity each year, one line that shows the maximum value, and one that shows the minimum value. Can you get all three of these lines in a single pane?  

3.  Restrict your date ranges so that your visualization only shows the last 20 years of data (use the `Filters` card)

### 3. Creating and interpreting trend lines

Now we are going to add a trend line to our visualization. I am sure you are all familiar with trend lines, but do you know *how* they are created? Let’s start with a linear trend line...

- What does a linear trend line tell you about your time series data?
- How is this trend line estimated? (conceptually... we will go through some equations in lecture)

#### Trend Lines in Tableau

1. Open a new worksheet and create a line chart showing the monthly values of the commodity from 1990 through 2022.

2. Add a trend line to your chart.

3. When you click on the trend line, what information does Tableau give you about it? What does this information mean?

4. When you click on `describe trend model` what information does Tableau give you about it?

5. Change your x-axis to annual. Did your trend line change? How do you know? Why did or didn’t the trend line change when you changed the date aggregation?

### 4. Visualizing structural breaks

Usually, in long time series data, we can see distinct points where trends change. These are called structural breaks. There are ways to *test* for structural breaks, but for now, let’s visually inspect them.

1. Looking at your visualization of monthly carrot prices and the linear trend line, does your trend line accurately reflect trends in the data for the entire period from 1990 to 2022?

2. Identify a month-year where it appears that trends in your data changed.

3. Add a **reference line** at this month-year. (Right-click on the x-axis and select `Reference Line`) Does anything happen to your trend line?

#### Methods for Highlighting Structural Breaks

**Method 1:** Separate Your Time Series by Adding Color

1. Create a new calculated field named `before_after_break`. Use the `IF` and `THEN` functions and an appropriate `Date` function to populate this variable with “after” if the date is after the break and “before” if the date is before the break.

2. Drag this variable to the `Color` card.

3. Add trend lines to your visualization. What happens?

**Method 2:** Separate Your Time Series by Segmenting the X-Axis

1. Drag your new variable from the `Marks` card to the `Columns` shelf.

2. Sort your variable so that the “after” time period is shown following the “before” time period.

3. In the x-axis Edit Axis menu, select `independent axis ranges for each row or column` (right-click on the x-axis to access this menu).

4. Note: Typically, Tableau automatically adjusts these panes to be the same size, but you can set them to be different sizes based on the windows you have set by toggling back and forth in your date variable aggregation.

### 5. Creating panes to visualize mutiple time series

Sometimes we might want to view multiple time series in separate figures. We can do this with panes in our visualizations.

Let’s start by bringing in some price data for a few new commodities.

1. On the `Data Source` page, connect to the following data sources: `corn_prices.csv` and `tomatoes_prices.csv`.

2. We are going to create a `relationship` between these data sources and our current working file.

3. With the carrot data in the `canvas`, drag one of the other data sources next to it in the canvas. Do the same with the other data source.

4. Now go to a new worksheet, what do you see? What did we just accomplish?

Now that we have all these data sources in a single file and they are structured in a "wide" format, we are going to construct time series plots that let us compare trends in these commodity prices across time.

#### Comparing Trends Across Commodities

1. Open a new worksheet and create a line plot of the prices over time for each commodity.

2. Try formatting your figure: change colors, adjust sizes, etc.

3. Use your `before_after_break` variable to examine whether all the commodities appear to have a structural break at the time you identified for the first commodity.

:::{.callout-note title="You do it"}

1. Connect to the egg data that we assembled in R. 

2. Create a time series of the price. How many lines are there? What is the default calculation doing?

3. Differentiate the price series by dragging `Description` (a dimension) to the color under Marks. You should see two lines but the scales are off. What's wrong?

4. Rescale one of the series to match the other. You can go back to R to do this or do it in Tableau. In either case, you will want to use if/then logic.
