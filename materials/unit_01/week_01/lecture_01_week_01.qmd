## Cautionary note 
::: {.incremental}

- We will teach you enough to be dangerous

- We are introducing you to the tip of the analytical iceberg.  Learn more before you put this into practice.

- Incorrect analysis can lead to worse conclusions than no analysis

## What is time series data? {.scrollable}

Time series data is a sequence of data points collected over time. 

It typically consists of observations taken at regular intervals (e.g. every hour, every day, every week, etc.) and can be used to study trends and patterns over time.

## How is time series data used in business

Time Series Analysis 

- learn about trends 

- compare current period to past periods

Forecasting 

- educated guess about future values

- develop business strategy around forecasts

## Time series decomposition

Decomposition statistically deconstructs a time series into several components:

1. seasonality

2. trend

3. residuals or "noise"

[Hyndman & Athanasopoulos (2021)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/decomposition.html)

## Example {.scrollable}

## Structural breaks {.scrollable}

Analysts may want to identify changes in the time series that are not just noise

Statistically identifying these changes can be the goal of the analysis or an exploratory exercise

:::


## Exercise

Briefly describe one reason for a structural break in a time series.


## Forecasting Examples

Forecasting power demand to decide whether to build new power plant

Forecasting call volumes to schedule staff in call center

Forecasting inventory requirements meet demands

## Exercise

How could you use forecasting to improve decision-making in ag business or environmental and natural resource management? Provide an example



## Forecasting overview {.scrollable}

Using historical data to develop a model, then using the model to predict the future

Model quality depends on past data and assumptions

Forecasts are uncertain; we can quantify some of that uncertainty

:::

## Forecasting steps

1. Problem definition

2. Gathering data and institutional knowledge

3. Preliminary (exploratory) analysis 

4. Choosing and fitting models

5. Using and evaluating a forecast model

## Summary

Time series data is a common structure of data

Certain techniques are designed to analyze time series data

Forecasting is a common need

# Project 1

## Project 1 overview

Groups of 2

Choose an ag biz or enre management question to answer with time series data

Collect time series data

Analyze trends 

Generate a forecast 

Present results in class Fri March 10


## Example: Corn and Combines {.scrollable}


::: {style="text-align: center"}
![<https://www.farm-equipment.com/articles/5142-historical-corn-prices-provide-look-at-future-equipment-sales>](includes/corn_prices.jpeg){width="70%"}
:::
<!-- Historical corn prices and future equipment sales  -->

Context: Equipment dealers sell more when ag prices rise.  Most people grow corn near dealer x.

Question: Will corn prices rise or fall in the next year and by how much?

Approach: Analyze time series of corn prices (decomp).  Forecast corn PPI one year.

Present: Provide context (plot raw data) and describe decision. Explain your insights.  Use effective graphics. Tell your data story.


## Finding data

Many sources of public data (e.g., [St Louis FED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33528), [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/))

Choose data appropriate to answer the question 

Ali and Jude can help



## Analysis

Must include some:

- time series analysis (unit 1 week 2)

- forecasting (unit 2 week 3)

## Process

Identify an interesting question

Collect data

Develop analysis strategy, explore, refine

Develop presentation
