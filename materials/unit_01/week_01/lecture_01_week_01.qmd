## Cautionary note 
::: {.incremental}

- We will teach you enough to be dangerous

- We are introducing you to the tip of the analytical iceberg.  Learn more before you put this into practice.

- Incorrect analysis can lead to worse conclusions than no analysis

# Intro to Time Series Analysis

::: {.r-fit-text }
The problem: <br>
We don't know what will <br> 
happen in the future

::: {.r-fit-text }
The solution: <br> We can use past data to <br> make a guess about the future*

## What is time series data? {.scrollable}

Time series data is a sequence of data points collected over time. 

It typically consists of observations taken at regular intervals (e.g. every hour, every day, every week, etc.) and can be used to study trends and patterns over time.

## How is time series data used in business

Time Series Analysis 

- learn about trends 

- compare current period to past periods

Forecasting 

- educated guess about future values

- develop business strategy around forecasts

## Time series decomposition

Decomposition statistically deconstructs a time series into several components:

1. seasonality

2. trend

3. residuals or "noise"

[Hyndman & Athanasopoulos (2021)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/decomposition.html)

## Forecasting Examples

Forecasting power demand to device whether to build new power plant

Forecasting call volumes to schedule staff in call center

Forecasting inventory requirements meet demands

## Exercise

How could you use forecasting to improve decision-making in ag business or environmental and natural resource management? Provide an example



## Forecasting {.scrollable}

Using historical data to develop a model, then using the model to predict the future

Model quality depends on past data and assumptions

Forecasts are uncertain

:::

## Forecasting steps

1. Problem definition

2. Gathering data and institutional knowledge

3. Preliminary (exploratory) analysis 

4. Choosing and fitting models

5. Using and evaluating a forecast model
