## Part 1: R

1. Create a variable called `myage` and assign it the value of your age.

2. Create a vector called `grades` containing the following values: 88, 92, 75, 99, and 80.

3. Using indexing, print the third element of the `grades` vector to the console.

4. Create a data frame called `student_info` containing the following columns: Name, Age, Major, Absent. The data should be as follows:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
knitr::kable(data.frame(
   Name = c("John", "Emily", "Michael", "Jessica"),
   Age = c(20, 22, 19, 21),
   Major = c("AgBiz", "ENRE", "ENRE", "AgBiz"),
   Absent = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
))

```

5. Install and load the package `readr`.

6. Download the [Supermarket Sales Data](../inputs/supermarket_sales.csv) in csv format to a known location on your machine. (Note: The dataset will likely default to your Downloads folder, and it will be called `supermarket_sales.csv`. You can move the file to your preferred folder by cutting and pasting the file from the Downloads folder to the destination folder.) Review the description of the supermarket sales data, available in the [Supermarket Sales Data Overview](https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_00/inputs/supermarketdata_describe.html).

7. Using the `setwd()` function, set your working directory to the location where you have a file called `supermarket_sales.csv`. 

8. Using the `read.csv()` function, read in the file `supermarket_sales.csv` and assign it to an object called `mydata`.

9. Write a brief explanation of what you did in steps 1-8 and how it relates to the tutorial we did in class.

## Part 2: Getting Started with Tableau

We will be using two Tableau products in this course: Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public. Tableau desktop typically requires a paid subscription, but as students (and teachers) we get it for free. Your assignment for this week is to be fully prepared to use these two Tableau products on your *personal computer.* 

1.  Visit [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) and download Tableau Desktop using the 14-day free trial. Use your university email (colostate.edu) when you register. You can enter your product license key once you receive an email with your academic license. **Take a screenshot of Tableau Desktop open on your computer.** 

2.  Visit [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) and create an account. You will use this account to host your data visualizations, which you can then embed on your Google site. You will be required to use this to upload homework assignments.

## How to Submit

1. **Create a Webpage on Your Google Site:**

- Title the new webpage **Problem Set 1**.
- This page should include your responses to Part 1 and Part 2 of the problem set.

2. **Include the Following Content:**

- **Part 1:**

  - Display the contents of your log file, which you generated by sourcing your R script. (Refer to the lab instructions for guidance on creating a log file.)
  - Write your answer to Question 9 in paragraph form.
