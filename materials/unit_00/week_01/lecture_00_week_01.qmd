## Data is not the same as information. It is merely a collection of numbers and facts until we give it meaning. (Tim Harford, *The Data Detective*)

## The Oakland A's

The A's go on to *win* the American League West with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball.

How? *Data*! 

The team uses in-game data to drive team management decisions: 

  - sign players because they have high stats (e.g., on base percentage) for a good value
  
  - tell players to look for certain pitches because they tend to hit those pitches better
  
## Data-driven decision making is a process in which decisions are based on data and analysis rather than on intuition or personal experience.

## The objective of this course is to introduce this process of transforming data into actionable insights.

## This process requires understanding how to *read* figures (e.g., graphs, charts, and maps), *discern* between "good" figures and "bad" figures, and *tell effective stories* using data-derived figures. 

## Let's start with a few examples
(1) What does the figure tell you?

(2) Is it clear what the author's did to produce the figure?

(3) Was the research a shock or exactly as you expected?

&nbsp; 

Example 1: [Good Data Project](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcOPgDLX0AEDQj-?format=png&name=small)

Example 2: [Sustainable Happiness](https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WDVP-winner-poster-4th-happy-people.png)

Example 3: [Mapping Segregation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/census-race-map.html)

## Sharpening your data visualization tools
By the end of this course, you will learn skills to produce high-quality figures.

## D$^3$M {.smaller}

&nbsp; 

<!-- Data-driven decision making is a process in which decisions are based on data and analysis rather than on intuition or personal experience. It involves collecting data, analyzing it, and using the insights gained from the analysis to inform the decision-making process. The goal of data-driven decision making is to use data to make more informed, objective decisions that are likely to lead to better outcomes. This approach is based on the idea that data can provide a more accurate and complete picture of a situation than personal experience or intuition alone. Data-driven decision making is often used in business and government to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and make more effective decisions. -->

## D$^3$M Introduction Exercise
Turn to a neighbor and...

1.  Introduce yourself - name, major, fun fact.
2.  Find some common ground - find one shared characteristic. This must be something you did not previously know and something that is not *visible*.
3.  Discuss real-world examples of D$^3$M with your neighbor.  
4.  Share one example related to ag or natural resources with the class.


## Google Human Resources {.smaller}

**Google's Project Oxygen**: Google surveys employees about their managers and connects the responses to team output to figure out what attributes or management practices lead to more productive teams. 

&nbsp; 
<!-- https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/the-evolution-of-project-oxygen/ -->

**Google's PiLab**: Google conducts applied experiments to determine the most effective approaches for managing people, including increasing productivity, increasing happiness, and improving health.

&nbsp; 
<!-- https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/working-together-when-were-not-together/ -->

**Diversity at Google**: Google's people analytics team conducts analyses to identify the root causes of weak diversity recruiting, retention, and promotions. These analyses have led to efforts to reduce bias in job descriptions, develop diversity-oriented mentorship programs, and produce annual diversity reports.
