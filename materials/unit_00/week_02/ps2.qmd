Link to the description of the supermarket sales data available in the [Supermarket Sales Data Overview](https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_00/inputs/supermarketdata_describe.html).

## Part 1: Getting started with Tableau

Open Tableau and connect to the **Supermarket Sales** Data (`supermarket_sales.csv`).

Answer the following questions using information on the **Start Page**, **Data Source** Page, and by opening a new **Worksheet/Workspace**.

1.  Describe your steps in connecting to the data.
    
2.  Describe the dataset.

    - What type of data is `supermarket_sales.csv`? 

    - How many sheets are included in `supermarket_sales.csv`?

    - How many data fields are included in `supermarket_sales.csv`?

    - What is the type of the variable `City`?

    - What is the type of the variable `Total`?

3.  Describe the elements of the dataset.

    - What is the role of the variable `City`?

    - What is the role of the variable `Total`?

## Part 2: Data visualizations with Tableau

4.  Create a data visualization that shows **total spending by city**. Make sure to include a useful title and ensure that axes labels are easy to read and informative. 

5. Write a paragraph that discusses the figure created in Question 4. If you were presenting this to the regional manager, how might they use this information to **increase sales**?

6. Create a data visualization that shows **total spending by city and by gender**. Make sure to include a useful title and ensure that axes labels are easy to read and informative.  

7. Write a paragraph that discusses the figure created in Question 6. If you were presenting this to the regional manager, how might they use this information to **increase sales**?

**Save your workbook and publish your visualizations to your Tableau Public site.**

## Part 3: Applying the D^3^M Process to Tableau

In this section, you will apply the **Data-Driven Decision-Making (D3M) process** to analyze the **Supermarket Sales** data in Tableau. 

Your goal is to **determine staffing needs at each branch** based on sales trends and department-level insights. Follow the D3M framework to guide your analysis:

### **Step 1: Define the Objective**

Choose **one** of the following objectives to answer using Tableau: 

#### **Option 1: Identify Peak and Low Sales Times**  
**Question:** What times of day have the highest and lowest total sales?  

#### **Option 2: Compare Peak Sales Hours Across Branches**  
**Question:** Are there differences in peak sales hours across the three store branches?  

#### **Option 3: Department Sales Breakdown in Yangon**  
**Question:** How do sales differ across departments in Yangon?  


### **Step 2: Establish a Hypothesis**

Before conducting the analysis, write down what you expect to find (i.e., write down your hypothesis). Consider the following:

- Do you expect sales to peak at certain times of the day or week?
- Do you expect different store branches to have unique sales patterns that require customized staffing?
- Do you expect departments to have different staffing needs based on sales volume and timing?

---

### **Step 3: Collect and Explore the Data**

Describe what elements of your dataset you will use to test your hypothesis and answer your question. Recall that your dataset includes:

- **Transaction timestamps** to analyze sales trends by time and day.
- **Branch locations** to compare sales patterns across stores.
- **Product categories** to group sales into departments.

Use Tableau to and organize the data before building visualizations.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze and Visualize**

Create a data visualization that you will show to the regional manager to provide data-driven insights to help them optimize their staffing needs. For each question, consider the following:

- **Option 1:** Create a line or bar chart to visualize sales by hour.
- **Option 2:** Create a comparative visualization, such as a stacked bar chart.
- **Option 3:** Create a bar chart to compare total sales by department.

Your visualization should include a clear title, proper formatting, and annotations to explain insights. Be sure to save your visualization to a worksheet with an appropriate name.


---

### **Step 5: Interpret and Apply Insights**
- Explain how your insights gathered from creating the data visualization would inform staffing needs.  


### **Step 6: Communicate Insights**
Summarize your key findings and **provide actionable staffing recommendations** based on your analysis. Consider:
- What adjustments should store managers make to staffing schedules?
- How do differences between branches and departments impact resource allocation?

Use annotations in Tableau to communicate these insights clearly in your final dashboard.

**Save your workbook and publish your visualizations to your Tableau Public site.**
