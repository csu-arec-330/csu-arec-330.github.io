## Part 1: Getting started with Tableau

Connect to the `supermarket_sales.csv`.

Answer the following questions using information on the `Start Page`, `Data Source Page`, and by opening a new `Worksheet`.

1.  What type of connection did you use to connect to `supermarket_sales.csv`?

2.  What type of data is `supermarket_sales.csv`?

3.  How many sheets are included in `supermarket_sales.csv`?

4.  How many data fields are included in `supermarket_sales.csv`?

5.  What is the role of the variable `City`?

6.  What is the type of the variable `City`?

7.  What is the role of the variable `Total`?

8.  What is the type of the variable `Total`?

9.  Create a data visualization that shows total spending by all customers in each city a store is located in. Give your sheet and figure a useful title and ensure that axes labels are easy to read and informative. What did you find? Discuss how the stores could use this information to increase sales.

10. Create a data visualization that shows total spending for males and females in each city a store is located in. Give your figure a useful title and ensure that axes labels are easy to read and informative. What did you find? Discuss how the stores could use this information to increase sales.

11. Title your two sheets `PS2_Q9` and `PS2_Q10`, save your workbook, and publish it to your Tableau Public site. 

## Part 2: Data visualizations with Tableau

Answer the following questions that will help you determine staffing needs at each store branch. All visualizations should follow best practices for effective data visualizations, including a useful title, good formatting, and useful annotations.

12.  What times of day have the highest and lowest total sales? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption (annotation). Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS2_12`. 

13.  Are there differences in peak sales hours across the three store branches? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption (annotation). Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS2_13`. 

Now suppose that staffing needs are determined within departments. Department 1 includes products in the Fashion Accessories and Health and Beauty product lines. Department 2 includes products in the Food and Beverages and Home and Lifestyle product lines. Department 3 includes products in the Electronic Accessories and Sports and Travel product lines.

14.  How do sales differ across departments in Yangon? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption (annotation). Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS2_14`. 

15.  What percent of total sales in Yangon occur in Department 2 on Sundays? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption (annotation). Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS2_15`. 

16.  On which day of the week does Department 1 account for the largest percentage of total sales in Yangon? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption (annotation). Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS2_16`. (Hint: you will need to create a 100% stacked bar chart to answer this question) 

Save your workbook and publish it to your Tableau Public site. 

## How to Submit

You should create a new webpage on your Google site titled `Problem Set 2`. This webpage should include your responses to both Parts 1 and Parts 2 of the problem set.

Part 1 should contain answers to each question 1-10, including embedded figures from your Tableau Public site for questions 9 & 10. 

Part 2 should contain the embedded workbook (with a tab for each figure) from your Tableau Public site. 

Submit the link to your Google site webpage in Canvas.
