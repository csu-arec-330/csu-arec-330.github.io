# D^3^M 

## Setting

People that run businesses, government, or other organizations are striving to reach some goal and need to adapt to changing conditions.

## Human judgement as a threat to sound decision-making

- Decisions—whether in business, government, or other fields—are often influenced by human judgment. 

- Our intuition can be helpful, but it can also lead us astray. 

- Recognizing the predictable errors in our thinking helps us make better use of data and avoid common pitfalls in decision-making.

## Cogitive or psychological biases {.smaller .scrollable}

Predictable mental errors arise from our limited ability to process information objectively:

::: {.incremental}
  - **Confirmation bias**: Favoring information that aligns with our preconceptions.
    - *Example*: You believe that studying in the library is always more productive than at home, so you only pay attention to times when you were productive at the library, ignoring moments when studying at home was equally or more effective.
  
  - **Anchoring**: Overemphasizing initial pieces of information when making decisions.
    - *Example*: While shopping for a car, you see a high sticker price on the first car and assume all cars in your budget are a good deal by comparison, even if they aren’t.

  - **Gambler's fallacy**: Believing that past events influence future probabilities in situations where they do not.
    - *Example*: You’re flipping a coin, and it lands on heads five times in a row. You assume the next flip *must* be tails, even though the probability remains 50/50.
:::

Strong positive or negative emotions can also significantly influence decisions (Bucurean, 2018).

As humans, we are inherently susceptible to these emotional and psychological biases.

::: {.notes}
Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. 

The anchoring bias, or focalism, is the tendency to rely too heavily—to "anchor"—on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject).

Gambler's fallacy, the tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged

Behavioral economics studies why people behave the way they do

<!-- Empirical evidence: 
First, moods and emotions are interfering with managers’ ability to process information, specifically, negative moods and emotions diminishes the ability of the managers to process information, while positive moods and emotions lead to a greater ability to process information. Related with this issue, the second theme refers to the effects of moods and emotion to the making decision time. The main aspect we have pointed out here is that while negative emotions lead to increased decision-making time, positive emotions have a contrary effect. Third, positive moods and emotions lead the manager to make a decision being controlled by his/her heart not by t his/her mind. On the other hand, the decisions made by managers being influenced by negative moods and emotions are mostly controlled by their mind, not by their heart.-->

## Data analysis as part of the solution

Instead of relying solely on experience or gut instinct, businesses can use careful data analysis to help guide their decisions.

- Objective data analysis is less susceptible to psychological biases.

- However, data analysis alone is rarely the solution—it serves as evidence to support the decision-making process.

## The Idea

The premise of this class is to build **evidence-based decisions** using D^3^M. 

Data and analysis are important tools that complement—rather than replace—intuition and experience. 

By integrating data with our judgment, we can make more informed and balanced decisions!

::: {.notes}

D3M relies on facts in the data: Need to ensure quality and fidelity of the data

Choice are tested: The decision to go with a certain marketing strategy, color scheme, or phrase is based on data analysis demonstrating that the choice is better than the alternatives at achieving the objective

Inspired by experience but not completely reliant on it. There is context and information not always measured in data

D3m is risk aversing because decisions are made based on evidence and not emotions or gut feeling

Directive vs corrective because the organization is being proactive and making informed decisions rather than reacting to negative outcomes. This ad campaign didn't work so we should scrap it and start another one.

## Example: Addressing food deserts {.smaller .scrollable}

### Setting
A local government wants to improve food access in underserved communities. They aim to identify food deserts—areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food—and determine where to establish new grocery stores or other interventions.

### Data analysis as part of the solution
To identify food deserts, the government gathers and analyzes data such as:

- **Demographics**: Income levels, population density, and household characteristics.
- **Geography**: Proximity of neighborhoods to existing grocery stores.
- **Transportation**: Availability of public transit and average travel times.

The data is used to map food deserts and prioritize areas based on need and potential impact.

### Cognitive biases can influence decision-making
Even with data, biases can affect decision-making:

- **Confirmation Bias**: Decision-makers may focus on areas they already perceive as food deserts, ignoring contrary evidence.
- **Anchoring**: Overemphasizing certain metrics, such as population density, while underestimating the importance of transit access.
- **Emotions**: Favoring high-profile neighborhoods for political or personal reasons.

### The Solution
By combining data analysis with an awareness of these biases, the government can:

- Identify areas with the greatest need for interventions.
- Develop targeted strategies that address root causes of food insecurity.
- Monitor and evaluate the impact of new grocery stores or transportation improvements to determine effectiveness.

## D^3^M is expanding rapidly

-->

# D^3^M is a process

## D^3^M process overview

1. Define an objective

2. Establish a hypothesis

3. Collect relevant data

4. Analyze the data

5. Interpret the results

6. Communicate insights

Adapted from [source](https://www.smartsheet.com/data-driven-decision-making-management).

## 1. Define an objective {.scrollable}

What is the business or operational question you are trying to answer?

- **Examples:**

  - Should we sell our product now or wait for a higher price?
  - Should we contract for feed or purchase on the spot market?

Clearly defining your objective provides focus and ensures your analysis aligns with the problem at hand.

::: {.notes}
The USFS spends a lot of money on wildfire suppression. Their objective is to spend as little as possible while protecting life and property. They want to identify which fires are the most expensive and understand why in hope that they can spend less in the future.

USFS is interested in suppression expenditures after a large fire occurs. 

They use a regression model to study what factors explain variation in the suppression costs of past fires, then use that model to predict the suppression cost of a single fire. The predicted cost is compared to the actual cost.
:::

## 2. Establish a hypothesis {.scrollable}

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation or prediction based on your understanding of the system.

- What do you think the answer is, and why?
- Describe the mechanics of the system and explain your reasoning.

*Example:* "I hypothesize that contracting for feed reduces cost volatility compared to buying on the spot market because it locks in prices ahead of market fluctuations."

::: {.notes}
Wildfire management is complex. Some factors that drive resource use (and cost) are determined by human decisions while others are biophysical. Some factors can be anticipated while others cannot. Hypothesis: there are decisions about resource use that lead to higher-cost fires.

:::

## 3. Collect relevant data {.scrollable}

Gather the information needed to answer your question:

- **Identify the data:** What specific data will help you answer your question? (e.g., historical prices, production costs, weather patterns)
- **Assemble the data:** Will you need equipment, surveys, or external databases?
- **Evaluate reliability:** Are your data sources accurate and unbiased?
- **Organize effectively:** Collect data in a format that can be analyzed—avoid unstructured formats...or sticky-notes :-)


::: {.notes}
The USFS collects data on expenditures. Expenditures tend to be tracked well because someone has to pay those bills. It also collects data on factors that are expected to influence fire behavior and management strategy: 

- vegetation, topography, weather
- values at risk like homes
:::

## 4. Analyze the data {.scrollable}

Design an analysis strategy to address your question:

- Choose an appropriate method (e.g., statistical analysis, cluster analysis, or regression analysis).
- Test different scenarios to explore potential outcomes.
- Identify variables or factors that can be changed to better achieve your objective.

*Example:* Simulate how feed price volatility impacts profit margins under different contract terms.


::: {.notes}

They use a regression model to study what factors explain variation in the suppression costs of past fires, then use that model to predict the suppression cost of a single fire. The predicted cost is compared to the actual cost. Fires that exceed their expected costs can be interrogated more closely.

:::

## 5. Interpret the results {.scrollable}

- What do the results tell you about your original question?
- Identify actionable insights based on your findings.
- Reflect on whether the data supports your hypothesis or reveals something unexpected.


## 6. Communicate insights {.scrollable}

Present your findings clearly and effectively:

- **Tell a story with data:** Use visuals to show the audience the impact of the current decision and how an alternative could improve outcomes.
- **Highlight benefits:** Clearly articulate how the proposed change adds value or reduces risk.

*Example:* A graph comparing profits with and without a feed contract can illustrate the stability achieved through contracting.


::: {.notes}
Develop a graphic to show which fires lie above the regression line of cost on X. Then, look for patterns across the fires that cost more than expected. Find what they have in common.
:::

## 7. Implement, Evaluate, Restart {.scrollable}

- **Implement:** Act on your recommendations and put the decision into practice.
- **Evaluate:** Monitor the outcomes to determine if the changes achieve the desired results.
- **Restart:** Refine your approach and revisit the process for continuous improvement.

This cycle ensures ongoing adaptation and decision-making based on data-driven insights.

## D^3^M across scales 

People make decisions all day every day - some are big and consequential and some are small.  

Data can help make better decisions across the spectrum, and in some cases, may be the only determinant. 

::: {.incremental}
- Would you trust an algorithm to make decisions based on data without human input?

- How much would you rely on data for strategic decisions?

<!-- # Data storytelling -->


<!-- ## Importance of storytelling -->

<!-- Storytelling is fundamental to human existence.  We connect, share, teach and learn through stories. -->

<!-- Statistics provide evidence but we need stories to truly communicate the insights to the audience -->

<!-- Our brains are predisposed to remember stories -->


<!-- ## Let's look at an example: The minimalist version -->

<!-- ![source: <https://medium.com/@ccr20/post-9-the-functional-art-1f0ee13b225e>](figs/diamonds-1.jpg) -->

<!-- ## 3 elements of a data story -->

<!-- ![Source: Dykes, B. (2019). Effective Data Storytelling: How to Drive Change with Data, Narrative and Visuals (1st edition). Wiley.](figs/data_storytelling.png) -->

<!-- ::: {.notes} -->
<!-- - Explain: narrative and data help explain what is happening.  Context and commentary guide the audience through the meaning of what is being shared. -->

<!-- - Enlighten: a picture is worth a thousand words or numbers.  Graphs and charts help you see trends and patterns.  We will discuss some of the theory and best practices for making effective graphics.  You want to make it as simple as possible for the audience to see your insight. -->

<!-- - Engage: narrative and visuals help engage the audience.  We spend billions on visual media entertainment.  The best movies may have good effects but definitely have a good story. -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ## Data story ≠ data visualization -->

<!-- While clear and appealing data visualizations are part of a data story, they are not data stories by themselves. -->

<!-- Data stories bring your analytical insights to life -->

<!-- ## Six elements of a data story -->

<!-- 1. Data foundation -->

<!-- 2. Main point -->

<!-- 3. Explanatory focus (vs exploratory) -->

<!-- 4. Linear sequence -->

<!-- 5. Dramatic elements -->

<!-- 6. Visual anchors -->

<!-- ::: {.notes} -->
<!-- 1. Story is grounded in data - something real that is observable -->

<!-- 2. The story needs to have a main point.  Have something to say. -->

<!-- 3. Your goal is to explain some insight.  What is going on?  Who are the actors?  What are the mechanisms?  This relates to what we will discuss about causal inference. -->

<!-- 4. Your story will consist of a series of supporting points or information that are tied together to build to some larger point.  The supporting information should build: a) consumer prefs are shifting to favor Kale, b) we offer more Kale products and sales increase. -->

<!-- 5. Dramatic elements include characters, setting, plots.  These elements help humanize the data story and make it relatable.  Set some context: sales are $200k.  Is that good or bad?  It depends on previous sales.  Be selective about the information - only include information that helps to advance the narrative. -->

<!-- 6. Visual anchors are the charts and graphs or other visuals you rely on to tell the story.  We will spend considerable time on developing effective visuals to help tell your story. -->
