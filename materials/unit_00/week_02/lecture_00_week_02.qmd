- Why and how

Data storytelling

- Why and how

## Fundamental problem

People that run businesses, government, or other organizations are striving to reach some goal and need to adapt to changing conditions


## Data analysis as part of the solution

Instead of experience or gut instinct alone, they can use careful data analysis to help guide their decisions (e.g., google, amazon)

Objective data analysis is less susceptible to psychological biases


## Cogitive or psychological biases

Predictable mental errors that arise from our limited ability to process information objectively 

Examples: confirmation bias, anchoring, gambler's fallacy

Strong positive and negative emotions can influence decisions (Bucurean, 2018)

Behavioral economics studies why people behave the way they do


::: {.notes}
Of the themes that emerged from the analyzed interviews, three hold particular significance. First, moods and emotions are interfering with managers’ ability to process information, specifically, negative moods and emotions diminishes the ability of the managers to process information, while positive moods and emotions lead to a greater ability to process information. Related with this issue, the second theme refers to the effects of moods and emotion to the making decision time. The main aspect we have pointed out here is that while negative emotions lead to increased decision-making time, positive emotions have a contrary effect. Third, positive moods and emotions lead the manager to make a decision being controlled by his/her heart not by t his/her mind. On the other hand, the decisions made by managers being influenced by negative moods and emotions are mostly controlled by their mind, not by their heart.

2. Establish hypothesis

3. Identify data need, build data process, collect data

4. Analyze data

5. Communicate insights

## D^3^M process overview: 1. Define question or objective

What is the business or operational question you are trying to answer?

- Do we sell now or hold?

- Do we contract for feed?

What resources do you need?

## D^3^M process overview: 2. Establish hypothesis

What do you think the answer is and why?

You should be able to describe the mechanics of the system  and explain your hypothesis

## D^3^M process overview: 3. Data

What data do you need to answer your question?

How will you assemble the data? Do you need equipment?  Will the data be reliable?

Collect data in a way that it can be analyzed - not sticky notes.

## D^3^M process overview: 4. Analyze data

Design an analysis strategy to answer your question

Model different scenarios?

What can be changed to better achieve your objective?

## D^3^M process overview: 5. Communicate insights

Use the data to tell a story

Articulate the benefits of the change



## D^3^M across scales 

People make decisions all day every day - some are big and consequential and some are small.  

Data can help make better decisions across the spectrum, and in some cases, may be the only determinant.

- Would you trust an algorithm to make decisions based on data without human input?

- How much would you rely on data for strategic decisions?

# Data storytelling


## Importance of storytelling

- Storytelling is fundamental to human existence.  We connect, share, teach and learn through stories.

- Statistics provide evidence but we need stories to truly communicate the insights to the audience

- Our brains are predisposed to remember stories

## 3 elements of a data story

::: {.notes}
- Explain: narrative and data help explain what is happening.  Context and commentary guide the audience through the meaning of what is being shared.

- Enlighten: a picture is worth a thousand words or numbers.  Graphs and charts help you see trends and patterns.  We will discuss some of the theory and best practices for making effective graphics.  You want to make it as simple as possible for the audience to see your insight.

- Engage: narrative and visuals help engage the audience.  We spend billions on visual media entertainment.  The best movies may have good effects but definitely have a good story.
:::

## Data story ≠ data visualization

While clear and appealing data visualizations are part of a data story, they are not data stories by themselves.

Data stories bring your analytical insights to life
