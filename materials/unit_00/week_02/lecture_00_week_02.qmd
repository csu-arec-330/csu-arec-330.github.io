D^3^M 

-  Why and how

&nbsp; 

Data storytelling

-  Why and how

## Fundamental problem

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; 

People that run businesses, government, or other organizations are striving to reach some goal and need to adapt to changing conditions


## Data analysis as part of the solution

&nbsp; 

Instead of relying on experience or gut instinct alone, they can use careful data analysis to help guide their decisions (e.g., google, amazon)

&nbsp; 

Objective data analysis is less susceptible to psychological biases


## Cogitive or psychological biases

Predictable mental errors that arise from our limited ability to process information objectively 

-  Examples: confirmation bias, anchoring, gambler's fallacy

Strong positive and negative emotions can influence decisions (Bucurean, 2018)

Behavioral economics studies why people behave the way they do


::: {.notes}
Of the themes that emerged from the analyzed interviews, three hold particular significance. First, moods and emotions are interfering with managers’ ability to process information, specifically, negative moods and emotions diminishes the ability of the managers to process information, while positive moods and emotions lead to a greater ability to process information. Related with this issue, the second theme refers to the effects of moods and emotion to the making decision time. The main aspect we have pointed out here is that while negative emotions lead to increased decision-making time, positive emotions have a contrary effect. Third, positive moods and emotions lead the manager to make a decision being controlled by his/her heart not by t his/her mind. On the other hand, the decisions made by managers being influenced by negative moods and emotions are mostly controlled by their mind, not by their heart.

## D^3^M process overview

1. Define objective

2. Establish hypothesis

3. Identify data need, build data process, collect data

4. Analyze data

5. Communicate insights

## D^3^M Process: 1. Define question or objective

What is the business or operational question you are trying to answer?

- Do we sell now or hold?

- Do we contract for feed?

What resources do you need?

## You Do It: 1. Define question or objective  {.smaller}

&nbsp; 

**In Pairs**: Identify a business that you might be interested in starting some day or any organization that you might want to work for. The business/organization should be related to agrulture and/or natural resources.

&nbsp; 

1.  Briefly describe this business (give the name if it already exists)

2.  Define a question or objective that business might face.

&nbsp; 

Include responses to both 1 and 2 in your iclicker response.

## D^3^M Process: 2. Establish hypothesis

&nbsp; 

What do you think the answer is and why?

&nbsp; 

You should be able to describe the mechanics of the system  and explain your hypothesis

## You Do It: 2. Establish hypothesis

&nbsp; 

**In Your Same Pairs**: What do you think the answer is and **why**?

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; 

Write a short response in the iclicker field.

## D^3^M Process: 3. Data

&nbsp; 

What data do you need to answer your question?

&nbsp; 

How will you assemble the data? Do you need equipment?  Will the data be reliable?

&nbsp; 

Collect data in a way that it can be analyzed - not sticky notes.

## You Do It: 3. Data

&nbsp; 

**In Your Same Pairs**: What data do you need to answer your question?  

&nbsp; 

List the data sources that come to mind in the iclicker field.

&nbsp; 

**Think about**: How will you collect and assemble these data? Do they already exist?

## D^3^M Process: 4. Analyze data

&nbsp; 

Design an analysis strategy to answer your question

&nbsp; 

Model different scenarios?

&nbsp; 

What can be changed to better achieve your objective?

## D^3^M Process: 5. Communicate insights

&nbsp; 

Use the data to tell a story

&nbsp; 

Articulate the benefits of the change

## You Do It: Analyze and Communicate

**In Your Same Pairs Discuss**: 

1.  How would you analyze these data to answer your question? What software would you use? What statistics would you construct?

2.  How would you communicate your findings to other people in the business? What visualizations might be useful?


## D^3^M across scales 

People make decisions all day every day - some are big and consequential and some are small.  

Data can help make better decisions across the spectrum, and in some cases, may be the only determinant. 

::: {.incremental}
- Would you trust an algorithm to make decisions based on data without human input?

- How much would you rely on data for strategic decisions?

# Data storytelling


## Importance of storytelling

&nbsp; 

Storytelling is fundamental to human existence.  We connect, share, teach and learn through stories.

&nbsp; 

Statistics provide evidence but we need stories to truly communicate the insights to the audience

&nbsp; 

Our brains are predisposed to remember stories

## 3 elements of a data story

![Source: Dykes, B. (2019). Effective Data Storytelling: How to Drive Change with Data, Narrative and Visuals (1st edition). Wiley.](figs/data_storytelling.png)

::: {.notes}
- Explain: narrative and data help explain what is happening.  Context and commentary guide the audience through the meaning of what is being shared.

- Enlighten: a picture is worth a thousand words or numbers.  Graphs and charts help you see trends and patterns.  We will discuss some of the theory and best practices for making effective graphics.  You want to make it as simple as possible for the audience to see your insight.

- Engage: narrative and visuals help engage the audience.  We spend billions on visual media entertainment.  The best movies may have good effects but definitely have a good story.
:::

## Data story ≠ data visualization

&nbsp; 

While clear and appealing data visualizations are part of a data story, they are not data stories by themselves.

&nbsp;
