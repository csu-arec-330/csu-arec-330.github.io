## Tableau Setup

We will be using two Tableau products in this course: Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public. Tableau desktop typically requires a paid subscription, but as students (and teachers) we get it for free. 

- Visit [Tableau for students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) and apply for your 1-year academic license.

- Visit [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) and download Tableau Desktop using the 14-day free trial. You can enter your product license key once you receive an email with your academic license.

- Visit [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) and create an account. You will use this account to host your data visualizations, which you can then embed on your google site. You will be required to use this to upload homework assignments.

:::{.callout-note title="Tableau eLearning Resources"}
If you are ever feeling lost in this class, I recommend checking out some of Tableau's free [eLearning resources](https://elearning.tableau.com). We will use some videos from these trainings throughout the course and I am happy to recommend specific resources to fit your needs.

## Applying D^3^M to analyze data in Tableau

In today's lab, we will use the **Supermarket Sales** data and apply the [D^3^M process](d3m_handout.pdf){target=\"_blank\"} to create data visualizations. 

After reading the [data documentation for the supermarket sales data](https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_00/inputs/supermarketdata_describe.html), we know that this dataset:

- Provides information about the transactions that took place in a supermarket chain. 
- Includes sales observations from 3 different branches over a 3 month period. 
- Includes information such as the date and time of the transaction, the products that were purchased, the price of each product, the total amount spent on the transaction, and other relevant details.

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### Scenario:
You are a data analyst for a supermarket chain tasked with providing insights to the district manager. The manager wants to improve customer satisfaction and sales across all branches. Your analysis will focus on identifying underperforming product lines, uncovering branch-specific trends, and understanding how customer ratings have changed over time. Based on your findings, you will recommend actionable strategies for improvement.

Using the **Supermarket Sales** data, we will apply the D3M process to create data visualizations that answer the following questions:

1. **Which product line has the lowest average customer rating across all branches?** 

  - Identify the product line with the lowest average customer rating based on the available data. 
2. **Do product lines with the lowest average customer rating differ by store branch?** 

  - Analyze whether specific branches have consistently lower-rated product lines. 

3. **How have average customer ratings changed over time?** 

  - Examine trends in customer ratings over time. 
  - Consider whether ratings have improved, declined, or remained stable.

4. **Have average customer ratings changed over time by store branch?** 

  - Compare changes in customer ratings over time across branches.

<!--
### The D^3^M process applied to the Supermarket Sales data 

#### Step 1: Define an Objective

**Prompt:**
What operational or business question are you trying to answer?

- Example: "Which product line has the lowest average customer rating, and how can we address it?"

Write your own objective here:

- _______________________________________________________________
- _______________________________________________________________

#### Step 2: Establish a Hypothesis

**Prompt:**
What do you expect the data will reveal? Why?

- Example: "I hypothesize that Electronic Accessories has the lowest customer ratings because customers may face issues with functionality or durability."

Write your hypothesis here:

- _______________________________________________________________
- _______________________________________________________________

#### Step 3: Analyze and Visualize

**Task:**
Create visualizations in Tableau to answer the questions:

1. **Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?**

2. **Does this differ by store branch?**

3. **How have customer ratings changed over time?**

#### Step 4: Interpret Results

**Prompt:**
Summarize your key findings:

- What do the results tell you about your hypothesis? Were there any surprises?
- What actionable recommendations can you make based on your analysis?

Write your interpretation here:

- _______________________________________________________________
- _______________________________________________________________

#### Step 5: Communicate Insights

**Task:**
Use Tableau to create a **dashboard** combining your key visualizations.

**Prompt:**
Imagine presenting this to the store manager. Summarize your insights in 1–2 sentences:

- _______________________________________________________________
- _______________________________________________________________

## The Tableau Workflow: Connect -> Analyze -> Share 

[Video: The Tableau Desktop Workflow](https://elearning.tableau.com/getting-started-with-tableau-desktop/699179/scorm/26hb0xo2vxhr) [Est. Time: 4 hours]

Tableau's workflow can be summarized in three stages: **Connect**, **Analyze**, and **Share**.

1. **Connect**: Link Tableau to your data source and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Analyze**: Use Tableau’s tools to explore your data, create visualizations, and uncover insights.
3. **Share**: Present your findings through dashboards and publish them to Tableau Public or other platforms for collaboration and decision-making.

This workflow ensures a structured approach to handling data, from connection to actionable results.

### Part 1: Connect

**Connect** to your data on the **Data Source Page** following these steps:

1.  Establish a connection

2.  View available sheets

3.  Select the first sheet you want to work with

4.  View and edit sheet metadata

5.  Connect additional sheets (optional)

#### 1. Establish a connection

Download [`supermarket_sales.csv`](../inputs/supermarket_sales.csv) and save it to a new folder in your working directory under `arec_330` called `lab_02`.

Locate **To a File** under the Connect toolbar and select **Text file**. 

:::{.callout-note}
Files that end in `.csv` are considered text files. The extension `.csv` stands for comma-separated values which allows data to be saved in a table structured format, even though it can easily be read in by Microsoft Excel and look very similar to files ending in `.xls` or `.xlsx`.
:::

![](figs/tconnect.png)
After the data is connected, it's time to save your work. Save the Tableau workbook as `arec330_lab_02.twb` in the same working directory (Note: You might have to navigate to the appropriate folder in your Windows Explorer or Finder). The default extension will be `.twb` so there shouldn't be a need to change the extension.

:::{.callout-note}
Make sure you select **Extract** (located in the upper right corner). In Tableau, live connections are dynamic and provide real-time updates, while extracts are snapshots of data that need to be refreshed. If your data file is not expected to change, then extracting will be preferred.

When **extracting data**, you will be prompted to save a file ending in `.hyper`. Save this file to the same folder where you saved your data (in this case, `arec330_lab_02`).
:::

#### 2. View available sheets

Once the data is connected, your screen will automatically display the **Data Source** Page, where you can view the available sheets. In `supermarket_sales.csv` there is one sheet.

![](figs/tsheets.png)

#### 3. Select the first sheet you want to work with

The bottom of the **Data Source** Page is where you can toggle between the Data Source Page and the available sheets within the connected data. 

![](figs/tsheets2.png)
For now, we will remain on the **Data Source** Page.

#### 4. View and edit sheet metadata

The metadata shows information about the data, such as the field name and data type. You can edit the metadata on this page.

![](figs/tmetadata.png)
To the left of the metadata and data preview, you will find additional metadata about the data fields. Here you can determine the data **type**. Data types tell you the *type* of variable. The three most common data types are string variables or characters, numbers or integers, and spatial or geographic variables (e.g., latitude and longitude, county, zip code).

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
What is the type of the variable **Gender**?
:::

#### 5. Connect additional sheets (optional)

Later, we will add additional sheets by connecting to new data sets.

![](figs/taddconnect.png)


### Part 2: Analyze

**Analyzing** your data in Tableau happens in the **Worksheet**/**Workspace**.

To switch to the **Workspace**, click on **Sheet 1** at the bottom of the Data Source Page.

![](figs/tworkspaces.png)

Use the **Data Pane** to view the data source and explore data fields within a worksheet. 

![](figs/tdatapane.png)

:::{.callout-note title="Role: Dimensions vs. Measures"}
Within the Data Pane view, we can determine the **role** of each data field. Because we have not calculated any variables yet, the two role options are **dimensions** or **measures**. 

- *Dimensions* are qualitative fields (like names, dates, or geographic data) that are typically used to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. They usually appear as rows, columns, or in filters. 

- *Measures* are quantitative fields (like sales, profits, or counts) that can be aggregated (summed, averaged, etc.). They often provide the numerical values that you analyze.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check 
What is the role of the variable `Gender`?
:::

In Tableau, there are multiple tools to assist you with analyzing data:

1.  Creating calculated fields

2.  Bar charts: Sorting, stacking, and bar-in-bar

3.  Using the `Marks` card for formatting

4.  Formatting titles, axes, legends, and tooltips

5.  Creating line charts and adding trend lines

6.  Organizing fields in folders

We will learn how to use these tools to answer the questions in our scenario:

1. **Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?**

2. **Does this differ by store branch?**

3. **How have customer ratings changed over time?**

### 1. Create calculated fields

Calculate the **total value** of each transaction using the `unit_price` and `quantity` columns.

Select the icon in the Data pane. 

![](figs/newvar.png){width="60%"}

Then select  `Create Calculated Field...`


![](figs/tsubtotal.png)

Give your field a useful name (let's use `subtotal`).

![](figs/tsubtotal2.png)

Create a new column `subtotal` = `[Quantity] * [Unit Price]`.

Drag the relevant variables into the calculation field. Type the appropriate function (the asterisk is the symbol we use to multiply two values). Click OK. And Voila -- the new variable will appear as a new data field in your Data pane.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Validate that the value labeled `tax` is indeed 5% of the `subtotal` by creating a new variable called `tax_verify`. 
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Explore some other options for data manipulation by clicking the right triangle in the **Create Calculated Field** box. Try creating a new variable of your choosing.
:::


### 2. Visualizing data with bar charts

Suppose we want to look at average customer ratings by product line to answer the question **Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?**

Locate the **Columns and Rows Shelves** in the **Workspace**. The Columns and Rows Shelves are used to create a structure for your visualization.

Drag `Product Line` into the Columns shelf and `Rating` into the Rows shelf. 

What did you notice? Aside from a vertical bar chart appearing, **Rating** (a measure) defaulted to `SUM`. 

If we want the average, we need to change the measure by clicking on the drop down menu next to `SUM(Rating)`, select `Measure (Sum)`, and change this to `Average`.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Suppose now that we wanted to display this in a horizontal bar chart. What would you need to alter?
:::

### 3. Sorting bar charts

You can **sort** the data so that the category with the highest rating is first, and the category with the lowest rating is last, using either the toolbar or the icon next to the y-axis label.

#### Option 1: Using the Toolbar
- In the toolbar, find the sort button, which typically looks like a pair of bars with an arrow pointing either up or down.
- Click the sort button to sort the data. Clicking once will sort it in one direction (e.g., lowest to highest), and clicking again will reverse the sort order (e.g., highest to lowest).

#### Option 2: Using the Icon Next to the Y-Axis Label
- Go to the Columns Shelf and hover your cursor over `Product Line` until you see the upside down triangle.
- Click this icon and find **Sort**.
- In the drop down menu, select either **Nested** or **Field**. The default is **Data source order**.
- You can either sort Ascending or Descending by Field Name (Rating) and Aggregation (Average).

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Sort the data so that the category with the highest rating is first and the category with the lowest rating is last.
:::

### 4. Using the marks card 

#### Using colors

What if we want to use **color** to highlight the top category?

There are a few ways to do this:

-  Drag `Product Line` to `Color` on the **Marks** card (then edit colors)

-  Right click the bar you want to stand out and click `Group` (then edit colors)  

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Locate the product line with the highest rating and highlight the category with a different color.
:::

#### Adding labels

What if we want to add **labels** with the value of the rating?

-  Select `Label` in the Marks card -> check `Show mark labels`  

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Show mark labels and click around with the other options on the label card. What formatting do you like best?
:::

#### Formatting the bars

What if we want to change the **width of our bars**?

-  Select `Size` in the Marks card -> Adjust (moving cursor to the right widens the bars) 

#### Displaying additional information

By default, hovering your cursor over the bars will display information. What if we want to add **extra info** on the box that appears when we hover over a bar?

-  Select `Tooltip` in the Marks card -> Click on `Insert` 

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Try adding some text to the tooltip. What else can you add to the tooltip?
:::


### 5. Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

#### Adjusting the scale of the y-axis

What if we want to **adjust the scale** of the y-axis so that differences across the bars are easier to see?

-  Right click the y-axis

-  Click `Edit Axis`

-  Under `Range` select `Custom`. Set an appropriate range by selecting appropriate values for `Fixed start` and `Fixed end`.  

:::{.callout-tip}
## Challenge Question
What if we want to compare customer ratings across **branches**? Does the product line with the top ratings vary by store?*
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Challenge Question
Highlight the product line with the top rating at branch A. How does this rank in the other branches?
:::

#### Changing the formatting of the axis labels

What if we want to **change the font size** (or color, etc.) of the axis labels?

-  Right click the axis you want to edit 

-  Click `Format`  

#### Renaming fields

What if instead of having Branch / Product line at the top of the bar chart, we want to rename A as Branch A, B as Branch B, and C as Branch C?

-  Right click **Branch / Product line** -> Select `Hide Field Labels for Columns`

-  Right click `Branch` in the Columns shelf -> Select `Edit Aliases...`  

-  Rename each branch under the column titled `Value (Alias)` 

#### Annotating the bar chart

**Adding a caption** that describes details about your visualization. 

- Right click the blank area of the visualization

- Select `Annotate` -> Select either `Point` or `Area`

-- By selecting `Area` you can add text to comment about a specific region of a visualization.

-- By selecting `Point` you can call out a specific data point in the visualization.

:::{.callout-note}
There are **many** other features to explore in the Tableau toolbar. Hover over each icon in the toolbar and click to explore.
:::

### 6. Using the filters card

What if we want to recreate our analysis of ratings for female customers only?

First, let's  **duplicate** the existing worksheet.

- Locate your active sheet (this should be called **Sheet 1**)

- Right click and select `Duplicate`

Your new active worksheet will be **Sheet 1 (2)**.

Now, let's add a filter for females:

-  Drag the field `Gender` to the `Filters` card

-  Select `Female`

### 7. Stacking bar charts

What if you want to see total sales split by gender and purchase category? 

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Create a visualization (in a new sheet) that shows total sales (`Total`) by `Gender` and `Product Line`.
:::

What if, instead, we want to see this in terms of the percent of total sales within each category are from females vs. males?

First, let's try **stacking** our bars and adding labels:

-  Move `Gender` from the Columns shelf and drag it to the `Color` icon on the `Marks` card

-  Select `Label` from the `Marks` card -> Check `Show mark labels` to display the value of total sales for males and females

Next, convert this display to see the percent of total sales that are from males and females:

-  Click the drop down menu next to SUM(Total) on the Rows shelf

-  Select `Quick Table Calculation` -> `Percent of Total`

This gives us the percentage of total sales that are from males and females, but as a percent of *all* sales.

What if we want to see the percent of total sales *within each category* that are from males and females?

We need to create a *100% stacked bar chart*.

-  Click the drop down menu next to SUM(Total) on the Rows shelf

-  Select `Compute Using` -> `Gender`

Note: The default is `Table (across)`.

### 8. Creating bar in bar charts

Another way to compare sales for males and females is to use a bar in bar chart. This will allow you to easily see whether total sales are higher for males or females.

-  Duplicate the 100% stacked bar chart by right-clicking on Sheet 2 and selecting `Duplicate`

-  Drag `Gender` to the `Size` icon in the `Marks` card

-  From the toolbar, click `Analysis` -> `Stack Marks` -> and select `Off`  

:::{.callout-tip}
## Challenge Question
What if we want to swap which gender is the wide bar and which is the narrow bar?  
:::

### 9. Basic line charts and datetime

The second type of chart we will learn to create is a line chart.  

Suppose we want to see trends in sales over time:

-  Open a new worksheet

-  Drag `Total` to the Rows shelf and `Date` to the Columns shelf

-  Click the drop down menu next to `Date`

-  Select `Week Number`  

:::{.callout-tip}
## Challenge Question
There are two options for each date display option. What is the difference between these fields?
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Explore the other date display options. Which do you like best for this analysis?
:::


### 10. Trends and trend lines

What if we want to see trends in sales across months?  

Let's look at two options for doing this.

1.  Side-by-side lines:

    -  Double click `Date` to add to to the Columns shelf, and drag `Total` to the Rows shelf.
    
    -  Set the aggregation to `MONTH(Date)` in the Columns shelf and `SUM(Total)` in the Rows shelf.

    -  Double click the `Date` field (again) in the Data pane. This will add it to the Columns shelf.

    -  Click the drop down menu on the `YEAR(Date)` field on the Columns shelf and select `Day`

2.  Combined lines:

    -  Drag `MONTH(Date)` to the colors card  

Note: Both date values need to be *dimensions*.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
You will notice that a new `Path` icon now appears on the `Marks` card. Experiment with different line types. 
:::

To add trend lines, from the toolbar select `Analysis` -> `Trend Lines` -> `Show Trend Lines`

### 11. Organize your data into folders

In Tableau, one way to reduce the number of fields you see if by organizing your data into folders.

**Step 1:** Right-Click a Field.

Start by right-clicking on a field (dimension or measure) in the Data pane that you want to organize into a folder. Let's pick `Product line`.


**Step 2:** Create a New Folder.

After right-clicking, navigate to `Folders` in the context menu. Select `Create Folder...` from the sub-menu.

If you cannot select `Folders`, you need to first select `Group by` in the context menu. Then select `Folders`. The default view in Tableau is `Data Source Table`.

**Step 3:** Name Your Folder. 

In the dialog that appears, give your new folder a meaningful name that reflects the fields you plan to organize within it. Let's name the folder `Product_Ratings`.

**Step 4:** Add Fields to the Folder. 

After creating the folder, you can add other fields to it by right-clicking them, selecting `Folders,` and then choosing the name of the folder you created.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comprehension Check
Locate the data field `Rating` and add it to the `Product_Rating` folder.
:::

**Step 5:** Select Group by Folder. 

To view your fields organized by the folders you've created, go to the drop-down menu at the top of the Data pane. Select `Group by Folder` from this menu. This will organize all fields in the Data pane into their respective folders.

![](figs/tgroupby.png)

:::{.callout-note}
Remember that organizing fields into folders is just for convenience and does not affect how you can combine data in your visualizations. You can still use fields from different folders together in your visualizations.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Lab Steps for Week 2: Introduction to Tableau"}
1. **Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?**
   - Drag `Product line` to **Columns** and `Rating` to **Rows**.
   - Change the aggregation for `Rating` to **Average**.
   - Sort the bars to find the product line with the lowest rating.

   **Reflection:** What does this reveal about customer satisfaction?

2. **Does this differ by store branch?**
   - Drag `Branch` to **Columns** and `Product line` to **Rows**.
   - Add `Rating` to **Rows** and change to **Average**.
   - Use the `Color` option in the `Marks` card to highlight differences.

   **Reflection:** Are there significant differences in ratings across branches?

3. **How have customer ratings changed over time?**
   - Drag `Date` to **Columns** and `Rating` to **Rows**.
   - Adjust `Date` to show `Month`.
   - Add `Branch` to **Color** to compare trends by location.

   **Reflection:** What trends or patterns do you observe?
:::

### Part 3: Share

You will **share** your **worksheet** on Tableau Public by following these steps:

1.  Connect Tableau Desktop to your Tableau Public account. 

- On the toolbar, locate `Server` -> click `Tableau Public`

2.  Publish your work to your account. There are two ways to do this:

- `Server` -> `Publish Workbook`

- `Server -> `Tableau Public` -> `Save to Tableau Public`

You should also save a local copy of your work as a Tableau Workbook. There are two ways to do this:

- On the toolbar, locate `File` -> click `Save` 

- Click the floppy disk icon (![](figs/save.png){width=5%}) at the top of the page

3.  Embed your visualization in your Google website.

{{< video https://youtu.be/uPdIgUIRnyo aspect-ratio="16x9" >}}

## On Your Own: Additional Review Questions

1.  Which payment type has the highest total spending?

2.  Do more females or more males use this payment type?

3.  Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in total spending over time?

4.  For a challenge: Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in the **number of customers using it** over time?

-----------

## This Week's Assignment
In problem set 2, you will follow this workflow to produce a simple data visualization using the grocery store spending dataset.  <https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_00/week_02/ps2.html> 

<!---
-  Selecting `Group by folder`

-  Right click a field you want in the new folder

-  Click Folders -> Create Folder...

-  Give your folder a useful name

Note that you can still combine data across different folders in your visualizations, you have just created a more organized data pane.
--->

<!---
3.  Use the Columns and Rows Shelves to create a structure for your visualization. You will create a visualization by placing fields on these shelves. You can place any number of fields on these shelves.

We will go into steps 3--7 of the analyze step of the process later in this lab.

4.  View your visualization in the `View Pane`.

5.  Change aggregations

6.  Use `Show Me`

7.  Use the `Marks Card`

Throughout the course you will continue to learn new features of the analysis capabilities of Tableau, but for now this is what you need to know.
--->


<!---
Now, we are going to go in more detail in the analyze step of the process. 

We will learn the following:

- Make a few new figures
- Additional features of the Tableau analysis page
- Ways to change the formatting of your visualizations to make them more effective

We will be covering the following:  

1.  Creating calculated fields

2.  Organizing fields in folders

3.  More advanced bar charts: Sorting

4.  Using the `Marks` card and creating groups

5.  Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

6.  Exploring the Tableau toolbar

7.  Using the `Filters` card

8.  More advanced bar charts: Stacking

9.  More advanced bar charts: Bar in bar

10.  Intro to line charts and manipulating dates
--->

<!---
### Creating groups

**Step 1:** Identify the dimension for grouping. 

Locate the dimension that represents the `Product line` in the Data pane. This is usually a field that categorizes your products into different lines.

**Step 2:** Create a group.

Right-click on the product line dimension in the Data pane. Choose `Create`... `Group` from the context menu. This action opens a dialog box for group creation.

**Step 3:** Select members for the group.

In the dialog box, you'll see a list of all the members (individual product lines) in that dimension. Select the product lines you want to include in your group. You can select multiple lines by holding down the Ctrl key (Cmd on Mac).

**Step 4:** Name the group.

After selecting the members, click on the `Group` button. Give your group a meaningful name, something that represents the collective product lines you've grouped. Then press OK.

**Step 5:** Using the group in visualizations.

The new group will appear in the Data pane, typically named as per your input. You can now use this group in your visualizations. Drag and drop the group field into your worksheet to use it in rows, columns, filters, etc.

**Step 6:** Editing the group.

If you need to make changes to the group later, right-click on the group field in the Data pane and select `Edit Group`. In the edit dialog, you can add or remove product lines, or make other adjustments to the group.
