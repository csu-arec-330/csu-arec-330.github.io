## Tableau Setup

We will be using two Tableau products in this course (although there are many more - [see handout](https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_00/week_01/handout_00_week_01.html)): Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public. Tableau desktop typically requires a paid subscription, but as students (and teachers) we get it for free. 

Visit [Tableau for students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) and apply for your 1-year academic license.

Visit [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) and download Tableau Desktop using the 14-day free trial. You can enter your product license key once you receive an email with your academic license.

Visit [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) and create an account. You will use this account to host your data visualizations, which you can then embed on your google site. You will be required to use this to upload homework assignments.

If you are ever feeling lost in this class, I recommend checking out some of Tableau's free [eLearning resources](https://elearning.tableau.com). We will use some videos from these trainings throughout the course and I am happy to recommend specific resources to fit your needs.

## The Tableau Workflow 

Connect -> Analyze -> Share 

[Video: The Tableau Desktop Workflow](https://elearning.tableau.com/getting-started-with-tableau-desktop/699179/scorm/26hb0xo2vxhr) [Est. Time: 4 hours]

### Connect

You will **connect** to your data on the **Data Source Page** following these steps:

1.  Establish a connection

2.  View available sheets

3.  Select the first sheet you want to work with

4.  View and edit sheet metadata

5.  Connect additional sheets (optional)

#### 1. Establish a connection

Download `supermarket_sales.csv` and save it to a new folder in your working directory called `arec330_lab_02`.

Locate **To a File** under the Connect toolbar and select `Text file`. 

Note: Files that end in `.csv` are considered text files. The extension `.csv` stands for comma-separated values which allows data to be saved in a table structured format, even though it can easily be read in by Microsoft Excel and look very similar to files ending in `.xls` or `.xlsx`.

![](figs/tconnect.png)
After the data is connected, it's time to save your work. Save the Tableau workbook as `arec330_lab_02.twb` in the same working directory (Note: You might have to navigate to the appropriate folder in your Windows Explorer or Finder). The default extension will be `.twb` so there shouldn't be a need to change the extension.


#### 2. View available sheets

Once the data is connected, you will auto-magically be taken to the Data Source Page, where you can view the available sheets. In `supermarket_sales.csv` there is one sheet.

![](figs/tsheets.png)

#### 3. Select the first sheet you want to work with

At the bottom of the Data Source Page is where you can toggle between the Data Source Page and the available sheets within the connected data. 

![](figs/tsheets2.png)
For now, we will remain on the Data Source Page.

#### 4. View and edit sheet metadata

The metadata shows information about the data, such as the field name and data type. You can edit the metadata on this page.

![](figs/tmetadata.png)
To the left of the metadata and data preview, you will find additional metadata about the data fields. Here you can determine the data **type**.

**You do it:** What is the type of the variable `Gender`?

#### 5. Connect additional sheets (optional)

Later, we will add additional sheets by connecting to new data sets.

![](figs/taddconnect.png)



### Analyze

You will **analyze** your data in a **worksheet**/**workspace** following these steps:

1.  Click on `Sheet 1` at the bottom of the Data Source Page. This action brings you to the **Worksheets/Workspaces Page**. 

![](figs/tworkspaces.png)


2.  Use the `Data Pane` to view the data source and explore data fields within a worksheet. 

![](figs/tdatapane.png)

Within the Data pane view, we can determine the **role** of each data field. Because we have not calculated any variables yet, the two role options are **dimensions** or **measures**. *Dimensions* are qualitative fields (like names, dates, or geographic data) that are typically used to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. They usually appear as rows, columns, or in filters. *Measures* are quantitative fields (like sales, profits, or counts) that can be aggregated (summed, averaged, etc.). They often provide the numerical values that you analyze.

**You do it:** What is the role of the variable `Gender`?

3.  Use the Columns and Rows Shelves to create a structure for your visualization. You will create a visualization by placing fields on these shelves. You can place any number of fields on these shelves.

We will go into steps 3--7 of the analyze step of the process later in this lab.

4.  View your visualization in the `View Pane`.

5.  Change aggregations

6.  Use `Show Me`

7.  Use the `Marks Card`

Throughout the course you will continue to learn new features of the analysis capabilities of Tableau, but for now this is what you need to know.

### Share

You will **share** your **worksheet** on Tableau Public by following these steps:

1.  Connect Tableau Desktop to your Tableau Public account. Server -> Tableau Public

2.  Publish. Server -> Publish Workbook. OR Server -> Tableau Public -> Save to Tableau Public

You should also save a local copy of your work as a Tableau Workbook. File -> Save. OR click the floppy disk icon (![](figs/save.png){width=5%}) at the top of the page.

3.  Embed your visualization in your Google website.

## Applying the Tableau Workflow

Using the Supermarket Sales data, construct data visualizations that answer the following questions:

1.  Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?

2.  Does this differ by store branch?

3.  What actionable insights does this analysis reveal for the stores?

4.  How have average customer ratings changed over time?

5.  Does this differ by store branch?

6.  What actionable insights does this analysis reveal for the stores?

In problem set 2, you will follow this workflow to produce a simple data visualization using the grocery store spending dataset. 

## Analyzing data in Tableau

Now, we are going to go in more detail in the analyze step of the process. We will learn the following:

- Make a few new figures
- Additional features of the Tableau analysis page
- Ways to change the formatting of your visualizations to make them more effective

We will use the same Supermarket Sales dataset. We will be covering the following:  

1.  Creating calculated fields

2.  Organizing fields in folders

3.  More advanced bar charts: Sorting

4.  Using the `Marks` card and creating groups

5.  Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

6.  Exploring the Tableau toolbar

7.  Using the `Filters` card

8.  More advanced bar charts: Stacking

9.  More advanced bar charts: Bar in bar

10.  Intro to line charts and manipulating dates

### 1. Create calculated fields

We will calculate the total value of the sale using the `unit_price` and `quantity` columns, and name the new column `subtotal`.

Select the icon in the Data pane. 

![](figs/newvar.png){width="60%"}

Then select  `Create Calculated Field...`


![](figs/tsubtotal.png)

Give your field a useful name (let's use `subtotal`).

![](figs/tsubtotal2.png)

Drag the relevant variables into the box. Type the appropriate function (what symbol do you use to multiply two values?). Click OK. And Voila -- the new variable will appear as a new data field in your Data pane.

**You do it:** Validate that the value labeled `tax_5_percent` is indeed 5% of the `subtotal` by creating a new variable called `tax_verify`. 

**You do it:** Explore some other options for data manipulation by clicking the right triangle in the Create Calculated Field box. Try creating a new variable of your choosing.

### 2. Organize your data into folders

<!---In your last assignment you were asked to use R to create a dataframe containing only a subset of your data, with the columns `city, product_line, unit_price, quantity, total, rating`--->

In Tableau, one way to reduce the number of fields you see if by organizing your data into folders.

Let's try organizing a few of our data fields into folders.

**Step 1:** Right-Click a Field.

Start by right-clicking on a field (dimension or measure) in the Data pane that you want to organize into a folder. Let's pick `Product line`.


**Step 2:** Create a New Folder.

After right-clicking, navigate to `Folders` in the context menu. Select `Create Folder...` from the submenu.

Note: If you cannot select `Folders`, you need to first select `Group by` in the context menu. Then select `Folders`. The default view in Tableau is `Data Source Table`.

**Step 3:** Name Your Folder. 

In the dialog that appears, give your new folder a meaningful name that reflects the fields you plan to organize within it. Let's name the folder `Product_Ratings`.

**Step 4:** Add Fields to the Folder. 

After creating the folder, you can add other fields to it by right-clicking them, selecting `Folders,` and then choosing the name of the folder you created.

**You do it:** Locate the data field `Rating` and add it to the `Product_Rating` folder.

**Step 5:** Select Group by Folder. 

To view your fields organized by the folders you've created, go to the drop-down menu at the top of the Data pane. Select `Group by Folder` from this menu. This will organize all fields in the Data pane into their respective folders.

![](figs/tgroupby.png)


Note: Remember that organizing fields into folders is just for convenience and does not affect how you can combine data in your visualizations. You can still use fields from different folders together in your visualizations.



<!---
-  Selecting `Group by folder`

-  Right click a field you want in the new folder

-  Click Folders -> Create Folder...

-  Give your folder a useful name

Note that you can still combine data across different folders in your visualizations, you have just created a more organized data pane.
--->


### 3. Visualizing data with bar charts

<!---Let's start off with our bar chart from last class where we looked at customer ratings by product line...--->

Suppose we want to look at average customer ratings by product line.

What are some ways we could visualize this to answer the question "Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?"

Locate the **Columns and Rows Shelves** in workspace. The Columns and Rows Shelves are used to create a structure for your visualization.

Suppose we want to create a vertical bar chart. Simply drag `Product line` into the Columns shelf and `Rating` into the Rows shelf. 

What did you notice? Aside from a vertical bar chart appearing, the Measure of Rating defaulted to `SUM`. If we want the average, we need to change the measure by clicking on the dropdown menu next to `SUM(Rating)`, select `Measure (Sum)`, and change this to `Average`.

**You do it:** Suppose now that we wanted to display this in a horizontal bar chart. What would you need to alter?


### 4. Sorting bar charts

::: notes
Title, adding color to highlight the top category, making font larger and easier to read, maybe changing axis range
:::

You can **sort** the data so that the category with the highest rating is first, and the category with the lowest rating is last, using either the toolbar or the icon next to the y-axis label.

#### Option 1: Using the Toolbar
- Click on the bar chart you want to sort.
- Look for the toolbar at the top of the Tableau workspace.
- In the toolbar, find the sort button, which typically looks like a pair of bars with an arrow pointing either up or down.
- Click the sort button to sort the data. Clicking once will sort it in one direction (e.g., lowest to highest), and clicking again will reverse the sort order (e.g., highest to lowest).

#### Option 2: Using the Icon Next to the Y-Axis Label
- Click on your bar chart.
- Find the y-axis (vertical axis) label. This is usually where your categories or group names are listed.
- Next to the axis label, there should be a small sort icon. This icon is usually an arrow or a pair of arrows pointing up and down.
- Click on this icon to sort the bars. The first click sorts in ascending order (lowest to highest), the second click sorts in descending order (highest to lowest), and the third click restores it to its default ordering.

**You do it:** Sort the data so that the category with the highest rating is first and the category with the lowest rating is last.

### 5. Using the marks card 

#### Using colors

What if we want to use **color** to highlight the top category?

There are a few ways to do this:

-  Drag `Product line` to `Color` on the **Marks** card (then edit colors)

-  Right click the bar you want to stand out and click `Group` (then edit colors)  

**You do it:** Locate the product line with the highest rating and highlight the category with a different color.

#### Adding labels

What if we want to add **labels** with the value of the rating?

-  Select `Label` in the Marks card -> check `Show mark labels`  

**You do it:** Show mark labels and click around with the other options on the label card. What formatting do you like best?

#### Formatting the bars

What if we want to change the **width of our bars**?

-  Select `Size` in the Marks card -> Adjust (moving cursor to the right widens the bars) 

#### Displaying additional information

By default, hovering your cursor over the bars will display information. What if we want to add **extra info** on the box that appears when we hover over a bar?

-  Select `Tooltip` in the Marks card -> Click on `Insert` 

**You do it:** Try adding some text to the tooltip. What else can you add to the tooltip?


<!---
### Creating groups

**Step 1:** Identify the dimension for grouping. 

Locate the dimension that represents the `Product line` in the Data pane. This is usually a field that categorizes your products into different lines.

**Step 2:** Create a group.

Right-click on the product line dimension in the Data pane. Choose `Create`... `Group` from the context menu. This action opens a dialog box for group creation.

**Step 3:** Select members for the group.

In the dialog box, you'll see a list of all the members (individual product lines) in that dimension. Select the product lines you want to include in your group. You can select multiple lines by holding down the Ctrl key (Cmd on Mac).

**Step 4:** Name the group.

After selecting the members, click on the `Group` button. Give your group a meaningful name, something that represents the collective product lines you've grouped. Then press OK.

**Step 5:** Using the group in visualizations.

The new group will appear in the Data pane, typically named as per your input. You can now use this group in your visualizations. Drag and drop the group field into your worksheet to use it in rows, columns, filters, etc.

**Step 6:** Editing the group.

If you need to make changes to the group later, right-click on the group field in the Data pane and select `Edit Group`. In the edit dialog, you can add or remove product lines, or make other adjustments to the group.
--->

### 6. Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

#### Adjusting the scale of the y-axis

What if we want to **adjust the scale** of the y-axis so that differences across the bars are easier to see?

-  Right click the y-axis

-  Click `Edit Axis`

-  Under `Range` select `Custom`. Set an appropriate range by selecting appropriate values for `Fixed start` and `Fixed end`.  

*Challenge question: What if we want to compare customer ratings across **branches**? Does the product line with the top ratings vary by store?*

**You do it:** Highlight the product line with the top rating at branch A. How does this rank in the other branches?

<!---**You do it:** Click on the different options in the legend.--->

#### Changing the formatting of the axis labels

What if we want to **change the font size** (or color, etc.) of the axis labels?

-  Right click the axis you want to edit 

-  click `Format`  

#### Renaming fields

What if instead of having Branch / Product line at the top of the bar chart, we want to rename A as Branch A, B as Branch B, and C as Branch C?

-  Right click **Branch / Product line** -> Select `Hide Field Labels for Columns`

-  Right click `Branch` in the Columns shelf -> Select `Edit Aliases...`  

-  Rename each branch under the column titled `Value (Alias)` 

#### Changing or hiding legends

What if we want to **remove the legend**?

#### Annotating the bar chart

**Adding a caption** that describes details about your visualization. 

- Right click the blank area of the visualization

- Select `Annotate` -> Select either `Point` or `Area`

-- By selecting `Area` you can add text to comment about a specific region of a visualization.

-- By selecting `Point` you can call out a specific data point in the visualization.

Note: There are **many** other features to explore in the Tableau toolbar. Hover over each icon in the toolbar and click to explore.

### 8. Using the filters card

What if we want to recreate our analysis of ratings for female customers only?

First, navigate to the toolbar and **duplicate** the existing worksheet.

- Select `Data` and find the data source name `supermarket_sales`

- Select `Duplicate`


Then, add a filter for females:

-  Drag the field `Gender` to the `Filters` card

-  Select `Female`

### 9. Stacking bar charts

What if you want to see total sales split by gender and purchase category? 

**You do it:** Create a visualization (in a new sheet) that shows total sales (`Total`) by `Gender` and `Product line`.

What if, instead, we want to see this in terms of the percent of total sales within each category are from females vs. males?

First, let's try **stacking** our bars and adding labels:

-  Move `Gender` from the Columns shelf and drag it to the `Color` icon on the `Marks` card

-  Select `Label` from the `Marks` card -> Check `Show mark labels` to display the value of total sales for males and females

Next, convert this display to see the percent of total sales that are from males and females:

-  Click the drop down menu next to SUM(Total) on the Rows shelf

-  Select `Quick Table Calculation` -> `Percent of Total`

This gives us the percentage of total sales that are from males and females, but as a percent of *all* sales.

What if we want to see the percent of total sales *within each category* that are from males and females?

We need to create a *100% stacked bar chart*.

-  Click the drop down menu next to SUM(Total) on the Rows shelf

-  Select `Compute Using` -> `Gender`

Note: The default is `Table (across)`.

<!---**You do it:** What do the other compute using options do?--->

### 10. Creating bar in bar charts

Another way to compare sales for males and females is to use a bar in bar chart. This will allow you to easily see whether total sales are higher for males or females.

-  Duplicate the 100% stacked bar chart by right-clicking on Sheet 2 and selecting `Duplicate`

-  Drag `Gender` to the `Size` icon in the `Marks` card

-  From the toolbar, click `Analysis` -> `Stack Marks` -> and select `Off`  

*Challenge question: What if we want to swap which gender is the wide bar and which is the narrow bar?*  

### 11. Basic line charts and datetime

The second type of chart we will learn to create is a line chart.  

Suppose we want to see trends in sales over time:

-  Open a new worksheet

-  Drag `Total` to the Rows shelf and `Date` to the Columns shelf

-  Click the drop down menu next to `Date`

-  Select `Week Number`  

*Challenge question: There are two options for each date display option. What is the difference between these fields?*

**You do it:** Explore the other date display options. Which do you like best for this analysis?

What if we want to see trends in sales across months?  

Let's look at two options for doing this.

1.  Side-by-side lines:

    -  Double click `Date` to add to to the Columns shelf, and drag `Total` to the Rows shelf.
    
    -  Set the aggregation to `MONTH(Date)` in the Columns shelf and `SUM(Total)` in the Rows shelf.

    -  Double click the `Date` field (again) in the Data pane. This will add it to the Columns shelf.

    -  Click the drop down menu on the `YEAR(Date)` field on the Columns shelf and select `Day`

2.  Combined lines:

    -  Drag `MONTH(Date)` to the colors card  

**You do it:** You will notice that a new `Path` icon now appears on the `Marks` card. Experiment with different line types. 

### 12. Adding trend lines

To add trend lines, from the toolbar select `Analysis` -> `Trend Lines` -> `Show Trend Lines`

For next time: What are trend lines?

## Review Questions

1.  Which payment type has the highest total spending?

2.  Do more females or more males use this payment type?

3.  Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in total spending over time?

4.  For a challenge: Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in the **number of customers using it** over time?
