## Tableau Setup

We will be using two Tableau products in this course (although there are many more - [see handout](https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_00/week_01/handout_00_week_01.html)): Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public. Tableau desktop typically requires a paid subscription, but as students (and teachers) we get it for free. 

Visit [Tableau for students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) and apply for your 1-year academic license.

Visit [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) and download Tableau Desktop using the 14-day free trial. You can enter your product license key once you receive an email with your academic license.

Visit [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) and create an account. You will use this account to host your data visualizations, which you can then embed on your google site. You will be required to use this to upload homework assignments.

If you are ever feeling lost in this class, I recommend checking out some of Tableau's free [eLearning resources](https://elearning.tableau.com). We will use some videos from these trainings throughout the course and I am happy to recommend specific resources to fit your needs.

## The Tableau Workflow 

Connect -> Analyze -> Share 

[Video: The Tableau Desktop Workflow](https://elearning.tableau.com/getting-started-with-tableau-desktop/699179/scorm/26hb0xo2vxhr) [Est. Time: 4 hours]

### Connect

You will **connect** to your data on the **Data Source Page** following these steps:

1.  Establish a connection

2.  View available sheets

3.  Select the first sheet you want to work with

4.  View and edit sheet metadata

5.  Connect additional sheets (optional)

#### 1. Establish a connection

Download `supermarket_sales.csv` and save it to a new folder in your working directory called `arec330_lab_02`.

Locate **To a File** under the Connect toolbar and select `Text file`. 

Note: Files that end in `.csv` are considered text files. The extension `.csv` stands for comma-separated values which allows data to be saved in a table structured format, even though it can easily be read in by Microsoft Excel and look very similar to files ending in `.xls` or `.xlsx`.

![](figs/tconnect.png)
After the data is connected, it's time to save your work. Save the Tableau workbook as `arec330_lab_02.twb` in the same working directory (Note: You might have to navigate to the appropriate folder in your Windows Explorer or Finder). The default extension will be `.twb` so there shouldn't be a need to change the extension.


#### 2. View available sheets

Once the data is connected, you will auto-magically be taken to the Data Source Page, where you can view the available sheets. In `supermarket_sales.csv` there is one sheet.

![](figs/tsheets.png)

#### 3. Select the first sheet you want to work with

At the bottom of the Data Source Page is where you can toggle between the Data Source Page and the available sheets within the connected data. 

![](figs/tsheets2.png)
For now, we will remain on the Data Source Page.

#### 4. View and edit sheet metadata

The metadata shows information about the data, such as the field name and data type. You can edit the metadata on this page.

![](figs/tmetadata.png)
To the left of the metadata and data preview, you will find additional metadata about the data fields. Here you can determine the data **type**.

**You do it:** What is the type of the variable `Gender`?

#### 5. Connect additional sheets (optional)

Later, we will add additional sheets by connecting to new data sets.

![](figs/taddconnect.png)



### Analyze

You will **analyze** your data in a **worksheet**/**workspace** following these steps:

1.  Click on `Sheet 1` at the bottom of the Data Source Page. This action brings you to the **Worksheets/Workspaces Page**. 

![](figs/tworkspaces.png)


2.  Use the `Data Pane` to view the data source and explore data fields within a worksheet. 

![](figs/tdatapane.png)

Within the Data Pane view, we can determine the **role** of each data field. Because we have not calculated any variables yet, the two role options are **dimensions** or **measures**. *Dimensions* are qualitative fields (like names, dates, or geographic data) that are typically used to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. They usually appear as rows, columns, or in filters. *Measures* are quantitative fields (like sales, profits, or counts) that can be aggregated (summed, averaged, etc.). They often provide the numerical values that you analyze.

**You do it:** What is the role of the variable `Gender`?

3.  Use the Columns and Rows Shelves to create a structure for your visualization. You will create a visualization by placing fields on these shelves. You can place any number of fields on these shelves.

We will go into steps 3--7 of the analyze step of the process later in this lab.

4.  View your visualization in the `View Pane`.

5.  Change aggregations

6.  Use `Show Me`

7.  Use the `Marks Card`

Throughout the course you will continue to learn new features of the analysis capabilities of Tableau, but for now this is what you need to know.

### Share

You will **share** your **worksheet** on Tableau Public by following these steps:

1.  Connect Tableau Desktop to your Tableau Public account. Server -> Tableau Public

2.  Publish. Server -> Publish Workbook. OR Server -> Tableau Public -> Save to Tableau Public

You should also save a local copy of your work as a Tableau Workbook. File -> Save. OR click the floppy disk icon (![](figs/save.png){width=5%}) at the top of the page.

3.  Embed your visualization in your Google website.

## Applying The Tableau Workflow

Using the Supermarket Sales data, construct data visualizations that answer the following questions:

1.  Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?

2.  Does this differ by store branch?

3.  What actionable insights does this analysis reveal for the stores?

4.  How have average customer ratings changed over time?

5.  Does this differ by store branch?

6.  What actionable insights does this analysis reveal for the stores?

In problem set 2, you will follow this workflow to produce a simple data visualization using the grocery store spending dataset. 

## Analyzing data in Tableau

Now, we are going to go in more detail in the analyze step of the process. We will learn the following:

- Make a few new figures
- Additional features of the Tableau analysis page
- Ways to change the formatting of your visualizations to make them more effective

We will use the same Supermarket Sales dataset. We will be covering the following:  

1.  Creating calculated fields

2.  Organizing fields in folders

3.  More advanced bar charts: Sorting

4.  Using the `Marks` card and creating groups

5.  Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

6.  Exploring the Tableau toolbar

7.  Using the `Filters` card

8.  More advanced bar charts: Stacking

9.  More advanced bar charts: Bar in bar

10.  Intro to line charts and manipulating dates

### 1. Create calculated fields

We will calculate the total value of the sale using the `unit_price` and `quantity` columns, and name the new column `subtotal`.

Select the icon in the data pane. 

![](figs/newvar.png){width="60%"}

Then select  `Create Calculated Field...`


![](figs/tsubtotal.png)

Give your field a useful name (let's use `subtotal`).

![](figs/tsubtotal2.png)

Drag the relevant variables into the box. Type the appropriate function (what symbol do you use to multiply two values?). Click OK. And Voila -- the new variable will appear as a new data field in your data pane.

**You do it:** Validate that the value labeled `tax_5_percent` is indeed 5% of the `subtotal` by creating a new variable called `tax_verify`. 

**You do it:** Explore some other options for data manipulation by clicking the right triangle in the Create Calculated Field box. Try creating a new variable of your choosing.

### 2. Organize your data into folders

<!---In your last assignment you were asked to use R to create a dataframe containing only a subset of your data, with the columns `city, product_line, unit_price, quantity, total, rating`--->

In Tableau, one way to reduce the number of fields you see if by organizing your data into folders.

Try organizing your data into folders by:

-  Selecting `Group by folder`

-  Right click a field you want in the new folder

-  Click Folders -> Create Folder...

-  Give your folder a useful name

-  Note that you can still combine data across different folders in your visualizations, you have just created a more organized data pane.

### 3. Sorting bar charts

Let's start off with our bar chart from last class where we looked at customer ratings by product line...

From our lecture on Wednesday, what are some ways we could improve this visualization to answer the question "Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?"

::: notes
Title, adding color to highlight the top category, making font larger and easier to read, maybe changing axis range
:::

What about **sorting**?

There are a two ways to sort bars on our chart:

-  use the toolbar

-  use the icon next to the y-axis label  

**You do it:** Sort the data so that the category with the highest rating is first and the category with the lowest rating is last.

### 4. Using the marks card and creating groups

What if we want to **use color** to highlight the top category? 

There are a few ways to do this:

-  Drag product line to `color` on the Marks card (then edit colors)

-  Right click the bar you want to stand out and click `Group` (then edit colors)  

What if we want to add **labels** with the value of the rating?

-  Label -> check `show mark labels`  

**You do it:** Show mark labels and click around with the other options on the label card. What formatting do you like best?

What if we want to change the **width of our bars**?

-  Size -> adjust!  

What if we want to add some extra info on the box that appears when we hover over a bar?

-  Tooltip  

**You do it:** Try adding some text to the tooltip. Click on Insert -> what else can you add to the tooltip?

### 5. Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

What if we want to **adjust the scale** of the y-axis so that differences across the bars are easier to see?

-  Right click the y-axis

-  Click edit axis

-  Choose an appropriate range  

Now what happens if we compare these customer ratings across branches? Does the product line with the top ratings vary by store?

**You do it:** Highlight the product line with the top rating at branch A - how does this rank in the other branches?

**You do it:** Click on the different options in the legend - what happens?

What if we want to **change the font size** (or color, etc.) of the axis labels?

-  Right click the axis you want to edit -> click Format  

What if instead of having Branch/Product line at the top, we just rename A as Branch A, B as Branch B, etc.

-  Right click Branch / Product line -> Hide field labels

-  Right click branch -> Edit Aliases...  

**You do it:** Play with the formatting of your visualization until you are satisfied with its appearance.

What if we want to **remove the legend**?

**Adding a caption** that describes details about your visualization. -> Right click the visualization.

**Marking** or **annotating** a single point. -> Right click -> Mark Label or Annotate

### 6. Other features in the toolbar

Let's explore the Tableau toolbar... Hover over each icon in the toolbar... Click each icon in the toolbar!

### 7. Using the filters card

What if we want to recreate our analysis of ratings for female customers only?

Let's use the toolbar to **duplicate** our worksheet.

Next, let's add a filter for females:

-  Drag the field `gender` to the `Filters` card

-  Select `Female`

### 8. Stacking bar charts

What if you want to see total sales split by gender and purchase category? 

**You do it:** Create a visualization (in a new sheet) that shows total sales by gender and product line.

Great, now what if we instead want to see this in terms of what percent of total sales within each category are from females vs. males?

Let's try **stacking** our bars instead:

-  Move gender from the rows shelf and drag it to the `Color` icon on the `Marks` card.  

What if we want to see the value of total sales for males and females?

-  Label -> Show Mark Labels  

What if we instead want to see the percent of total sales that are from males and females?

-  Click the dropdown menu on SUM(Total)

-  Quick Table Calculation -> Percent of Total  

Now what if we want to see the percent of total sales within each category that are from males and females?

-  Create a 100% stacked bar chart

-  Click the dropdown menu on SUM(Total)

-  Compute Using -> Gender  

**You do it:** What do the other compute using options do?

### 9. Creating bar in bar charts

Another way to compare sales for males and females is to use a bar in bar chart. This will allow you to easily see whether total sales are higher for males or females.

-  Let's duplicate our 100% stacked bar chart

-  Drag gender to the `Size` icon in the `Marks` card

-  From the top menu, click Analysis -> Stack Marks -> Off  

What if we want to swap which gender is the wide bar?  

### 10. Basic line charts and datetime

The second type of chart we will learn to create is a line chart.  

Suppose we want to see trends in sales over time:

-  Open a new worksheet

-  Drag `Total` to the rows shelf and `Date` to the columns shelf

-  Click the dropdown menu next to `Date`

-  Click Week Number  

**You do it:** Explore the other date display options. Which do you like best for this analysis?

What if we want to see trends in sales across months?  

Let's look at two options for doing this:

1.  Side-by-side lines:

    -  With the `Date` aggregation set to MONTH in the columns shelf, double click the `Date` field.

    -  Click the dropdown menu on the YEAR(Date) field on the columns shelf

    -  Select Day

2.  Combined lines:

    -  Drag MONTH(Date) to the colors card  

Let's look at different line types. Click the new `Path` icon on the Marks card

Let's add some trend lines. Analysis -> Trend lines -> Show Trend Lines

What are trend lines??

### 11. Review

1.  Which payment type has the highest total spending?

2.  Do more females or more males use this payment type?

3.  Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in total spending over time?

4.  For a challenge: Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in the **number of customers using it** over time?
