### Description
This supermarket dataset is a collection of data that provides information about the transactions that took place in a supermarket chain. The dataset includes sales observations from 3 different branches over a 3 month period. This dataset includes information such as the date and time of the transaction, the products that were purchased, the price of each product, the total amount spent on the transaction, and other relevant details.

We will use this dataset to perform exploratory data analysis and gain insights into the behavior of the supermarket customers. We will use this dataset to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior to develop marketing and advertising strategies.

Overall, this supermarket dataset can be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of supermarket customers, and for making data-driven decisions that can improve the performance of a supermarket business.
