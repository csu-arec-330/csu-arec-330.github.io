## Tableau Lab Overview

In week 2 of the course we covered the basic Tableau flow of analysis: Connect -> Analyze -> Share. Each of you followed this flow in problem set 2 to produce a simple data visualization using the grocery store spending dataset. 

Today we are going to go in more detail in the analyze step of the process. We will learn to make a few new figures, we will learn more of the features of the Tableau analysis page, and we will discuss a few ways to change the formatting of your visualizations to make them more effective.

We will be using the same Supermarket Sales dataset, picking up where we left off with our analysis of product line ratings. We will be covering the following:  

1.  Creating calculated fields

2.  Organizing fields in folders

3.  More advanced bar charts: Sorting

4.  Using the `Marks` card and creating groups

5.  Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

6.  Exploring the Tableau toolbar

7.  Using the `Filters` card

8.  More advanced bar charts: Stacking

9.  More advanced bar charts: Bar in bar

10.  Intro to line charts and manipulating dates

### 1. Create calculated fields

In your last assignment you were asked to use R to calculate the total value of the sale using the `unit_price` and `quantity` columns. (And name the new column `subtotal`.)

We can do this sort of calculation in Tableau too!

![](includes/newvar.png){width="60%"}

Then select  `Create Calculated Field...`

Give your field a useful name (let's use `subtotal`).

Drag the relevant variables into the box. Type the appropriate function (multiply). Click OK. And Voila.

**You do it:** Validate that the value labeled `tax_5_percent` is indeed 5% of the `subtotal` by creating a new variable called `tax_verify`. 

**You do it:** Explore some other options for data manipulation by clicking the right triangle in the Create Calculated Field box. Try creating a new variable of your choosing.

### 2. Organize your data into folders

In your last assignment you were asked to use R to create a dataframe containing only a subset of your data, with the columns `city, product_line, unit_price, quantity, total, rating`

In Tableau, one way to reduce the number of fields you see if by organizing your data into folders.

Try organizing your data into folders by:

-  Selecting `Group by folder`

-  Right click a field you want in the new folder

-  Click Folders -> Create Folder...

-  Give your folder a useful name

-  Note that you can still combine data across different folders in your visualizations, you have just created a more organized data pane.

### 3. Sorting bar charts

Let's start off with our bar chart from last class where we looked at customer ratings by product line...

From our lecture on Wednesday, what are some ways we could improve this visualization to answer the question "Which product line has the lowest average customer rating?"

::: notes
Title, adding color to highlight the top category, making font larger and easier to read, maybe changing axis range
:::

What about **sorting**?

There are a two ways to sort bars on our chart:

-  use the toolbar

-  use the icon next to the y-axis label  

**You do it:** Sort the data so that the category with the highest rating is first and the category with the lowest rating is last.

### 4. Using the marks card and creating groups

What if we want to **use color** to highlight the top category? 

There are a few ways to do this:

-  Drag product line to `color` on the Marks card (then edit colors)

-  Right click the bar you want to stand out and click `Group` (then edit colors)  

What if we want to add **labels** with the value of the rating?

-  Label -> check `show mark labels`  

**You do it:** Show mark labels and click around with the other options on the label card. What formatting do you like best?

What if we want to change the **width of our bars**?

-  Size -> adjust!  

What if we want to add some extra info on the box that appears when we hover over a bar?

-  Tooltip  

**You do it:** Try adding some text to the tooltip. Click on Insert -> what else can you add to the tooltip?

### 5. Formatting titles, axes, legends, etc.

What if we want to **adjust the scale** of the y-axis so that differences across the bars are easier to see?

-  Right click the y-axis

-  Click edit axis

-  Choose an appropriate range  

Now what happens if we compare these customer ratings across branches? Does the product line with the top ratings vary by store?

**You do it:** Highlight the product line with the top rating at branch A - how does this rank in the other branches?

**You do it:** Click on the different options in the legend - what happens?

What if we want to **change the font size** (or color, etc.) of the axis labels?

-  Right click the axis you want to edit -> click Format  

What if instead of having Branch/Product line at the top, we just rename A as Branch A, B as Branch B, etc.

-  Right click Branch / Product line -> Hide field labels

-  Right click branch -> Edit Aliases...  

**You do it:** Play with the formatting of your visualization until you are satisfied with its appearance.

What if we want to **remove the legend**?

**Adding a caption** that describes details about your visualization. -> Right click the visualization.

### 6. Other features in the toolbar

Let's explore the Tableau toolbar... Hover over each icon in the toolbar... Click each icon in the toolbar!

### 7. Using the filters card

What if we want to recreate our analysis of ratings for female customers only?

Let's use the toolbar to **duplicate** our worksheet.

Next, let's add a filter for females:

-  Drag the field `gender` to the `Filters` card

-  Select `Female`

### 8. Stacking bar charts

What if you want to see total sales split by gender and purchase category? 

**You do it:** Create a visualization (in a new sheet) that shows total sales by gender and product line.

Great, now what if we instead want to see this in terms of what percent of total sales within each category are from females vs. males?

Let's try **stacking** our bars instead:

-  Move gender from the rows shelf and drag it to the `Color` icon on the `Marks` card.  

What if we want to see the value of total sales for males and females?

-  Label -> Show Mark Labels  

What if we instead want to see the percent of total sales that are from males and females?

-  Click the dropdown menu on SUM(Total)

-  Quick Table Calculation -> Percent of Total  

Now what if we want to see the percent of total sales within each category that are from males and females?

-  Create a 100% stacked bar chart

-  Click the dropdown menu on SUM(Total)

-  Compute Using -> Gender  

**You do it:** What do the other compute using options do?

### 9. Creating bar in bar charts

Another way to compare sales for males and females is to use a bar in bar chart. This will allow you to easily see whether total sales are higher for males or females.

-  Let's duplicate our 100% stacked bar chart

-  Drag gender to the `Size` icon in the `Marks` card

-  From the top menu, click Analysis -> Stack Marks -> Off  

What if we want to swap which gender is the wide bar?  

### 10. Basic line charts and datetime

The second type of chart we will learn to create is a line chart.  

Suppose we want to see trends in sales over time:

-  Open a new worksheet

-  Drag `Total` to the rows shelf and `Date` to the columns shelf

-  Click the dropdown menu next to `Date`

-  Click Week Number  

**You do it:** Explore the other date display options. Which do you like best for this analysis?

What if we want to see trends in sales across months?  

Let's look at two options for doing this:

1.  Side-by-side lines:

    -  With the `Date` aggregation set to MONTH in the columns shelf, double click the `Date` field.

    -  Click the dropdown menu on the YEAR(Date) field on the columns shelf

    -  Select Day

2.  Combined lines:

    -  Drag MONTH(Date) to the colors card  

Let's look at different line types. Click the new `Path` icon on the Marks card

Let's add some trend lines. Analysis -> Trend lines -> Show Trend Lines

What are trend lines??

### 11. Review

1.  Which payment type has the highest total spending?

2.  Do more females or more males use this payment type?

3.  Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in total spending over time?

4.  For a challenge: Which payment type has seen the greatest increase in the **number of customers using it** over time? 


## R: `dplyr` continued

Last week we introduced the five `dplyr` verbs generally used to manipulate data.  We covered `mutate, filter, select,` and `arrange`.  We skipped over `summarize`.  Today we will introduce `summarize` and a helpful companion function `group_by`.  The `summarize` function is used to collapse multiple rows of data into a single row, by computing summary statistics for each group. This function can be used to summarize and aggregate data by computing statistics such as mean, sum, count, minimum, maximum, etc. for each group defined in the data. 

Let's return to our dataset `supermarket_sales.csv`.  Use the function `read_csv()` to read `supermarket_sales.csv` into a dataframe called `supermarket_raw` (see [lab 2](../week_02/lab_00_week_02.html#read-the-data-into-r)). We can use `summarize()` to calculate the total number of units sold in the dataset.   



`{r}
#| eval: false

total_sold <- summarize(supermarket_raw,quantity_summed=sum(quantity)) 
`
