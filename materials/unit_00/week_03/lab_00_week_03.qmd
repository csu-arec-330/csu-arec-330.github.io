This Lab Contributes to Course Objectives 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8

## Learning Objectives R


## Learning Objectives Tableau 

-  Apply advanced options in the connections page



## Lab Overview

In week 2 of the course we covered the basic Tableau flow of analysis: Connect -> Analyze -> Share. Each of you followed this flow in problem set 2 to produce a simple data visualization using the grocery store spending dataset. 

Today we are going to go in more detail in each of these steps. In the analysis step we will also discuss a few ways to change the formatting of your visualizations to make them more effective.

## Connecting Data Sources -- More Advanced Options

~~1.  Establish a connection~~

~~2.  View available sheets~~

~~3.  Select the first sheet you want to work with~~

~~4.  View and edit sheet metadata~~

5.  Create an extract

6.  Save your data source for instant reusable access

7.  Create a relationship between sheets (merge or join)

8.  Union (stack/append) sheets with the same fields

9.  Pivot a data field

### Analyze

~~1.  Click on `Sheet 1` at the bottom of the Tableau Desktop window. ~~

~~2.  Use the `Data Pane` to view the data source and explore data fields within a worksheet~~

~~3.  Use the Columns and Rows Shelves to create a structure for your visualization. You will create a visualization by placing fields on these shelves. You can place any number of fields on these shelves.~~

~~4.  View your visualization in the `View Pane`.~~

~~5.  Change aggregations~~

~~6.  Use `Show Me`~~

7.  More advanced bar charts

8.  Use the `Marks Card`

9.  Use the `Filters Card`

10.  Create calculated fields

11.  Showing and hiding the legend

12.  Formatting

13.  Line charts

14.  Manipulating dates

### Share

For the purposes of this class, you will only need to understand how to share your visualizations following the steps from last lab (publish on Tableau Public, embed on your google site). 

But another important aspect of sharing your analysis is building a **dashboard** (which you can share following the same process).

**Dashboards** are used to bring together multiple sheets, allowing comparison between the data simultaneously.

1.  Click on `New Dashboard` at the bottom of the Tableau Desktop window. 

2.  Drag your desired sheets to your dashboard.

3.  Move things around and add formatting.

4.  Add interactivity. 

## R: `dplyr` continued

Last week we introduced the five `dplyr` verbs generally used to manipulate data.  We covered `mutate, filter, select,` and `arrange`.  We skipped over `summarize`.  Today we will introduce `summarize` and a helpful companion function `group_by`.  The `summarize` function is used to collapse multiple rows of data into a single row, by computing summary statistics for each group. This function can be used to summarize and aggregate data by computing statistics such as mean, sum, count, minimum, maximum, etc. for each group defined in the data. 

Let's return to our dataset `supermarket_sales.csv`.  Use the function `read_csv()` to read `supermarket_sales.csv` into a dataframe called `supermarket_raw` (see [lab 2](../week_02/lab_00_week_02.html#read-the-data-into-r)). We can use `summarize()` to calculate the total number of units sold in the dataset.   

```{r}
#| eval: false
total_sold <- summarize(supermarket_raw,quantity_summed=sum(quantity)) 


```
