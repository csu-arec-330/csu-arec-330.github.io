## Part 1: R

Read in the dataset `supermarket_sales.csv`.

1. Use `dplyr` commands to calculate the median sales by payment type

2. You are asked to develop a new performance indicator for the company.  You wonder if the transaction rating per unit price might provide insights into consumer preferences for different product lines.  Calculate the rating per unit price for each transaction and call this new variable `rup`.

3. Then calculate the mean `rup` and unit price by product line across the dataset.  Print the contents of this dataframe into the console using the `print()` function.

*Use the sink command to generate a text file that indicates your script ran in R.*

## Part 2: Tableau

Connect to the `supermarket_sales.csv` and create *effective* data visualizations to answer the following questions that will help you determine staffing needs at each store branch. All visualizations should follow best practices for effective data visualizations, including a useful title, good formatting, and useful annotations.

1.  What times of day have the highest and lowest total sales? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption. Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS3_01`. 

2.  Are there differences in peak sales hours across the three store branches? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption. Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS3_02`. 

Now suppose that staffing needs are determined within departments. Department 1 includes products in the Fashion Accessories and Health and Beauty product lines. Department 2 includes products in the Food and Beverages and Home and Lifestyle product lines. Department 3 includes products in the Electronic Accessories and Sports and Travel product lines.

3.  How do sales differ across departments in Yangon? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption. Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS3_03`. 

4.  What percent of total sales in Yangon occur in Department 2 on Sundays? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption. Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS3_04`. 

5.  On which day of the week does Department 1 account for the largest percentage of total sales in Yangon? Explain what this means for staffing in the figure caption. Name the worksheet with this visualization `PS3_05`. (Hint: you will need to create a 100% stacked bar chart to answer this question) 

Save your workbook and publish it to your Tableau Public site. 



## How to Submit

You should create a new webpage on your google site titled `Problem Set 3`. This webpage should include your responses to both Parts 1 and Parts 2 of the problem set. Part 1 should contain an R script with the code used to answer the questions. Generate a log file and submit that to Canvas.

Part 2 should contain the embedded workbook (with a tab for each figure) from your Tableau Public site. Submit the link to your google site webpage in Canvas.
