## Exploratory data analysis

Explore your data to gain familiarity and stimulate questions

Generate summary statistics (average, variance, min, max)

Plot distributions and correlations between variables

## Methods overview

:::: {.columns style="text-align: left"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Unsupervised Learning**

To discover hidden patterns and relationships within the data

Identify structure or patterns on its own given an unlabeled dataset

Good for exploring relationships and generating explanatory questions

**Supervised Learning**

To explain relationships between inputs and outputs

Models are trained on labeled data (outputs and inputs known)

Good for explaining relationships and predicting new outcomes

# Unsupervised Learning

## Cluster Analysis

Cluster analysis is a form of unsupervised analysis

A systematic method to look for patterns in data

## Customer segmentation analysis

Use sales data to divide your customers into groups to better target marketing

## [ESRI Tapestry Segmentation](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/latest/regional-data/tapestry-segmentation.htm)

Uses cluster analysis on census demographic data (+ others) to define groups

## How does cluster analysis work? {.scrollable}

[K-means clustering](https://youtu.be/4b5d3muPQmA)

1. Choose the number of clusters (k) that you want to identify in the data.

2. Randomly initialize the k cluster centroids (points in space) within the data range.

3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, based on the Euclidean distance between the point and each centroid.

4. Calculate the mean (centroid) of each cluster based on the data points assigned to it.

5. Update the cluster centroids to be the means of the data points assigned to them.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until convergence (when the cluster assignments no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached).

Usually, we repeat this whole process a number of times and choose the group assignment that minimizes the overall variance

## Knowledge check

What is the main goal of the k-means clustering algorithm?

A) To minimize the distance between all data points in the dataset.

B) To minimize the distance between each data point and its assigned centroid.

C) To maximize the distance between each data point and all other data points.

D) To maximize the distance between each data point and its assigned centroid.

# Supervised Learning

## Regression

Used to estimate relationships between inputs (independent, explanatory) and outputs (dependent, outcome)

## Example: Ice Cream Sales and Temperature

## Classification

Problem: we need to classify data into discrete units (e.g., images, product types, sentiment)^[Can also be used on continuous data]

We have some units labeled and know information about them

## Wildfire Hazard Potential

## Spam email

## Decision Tree Classification

Classification as a sequence of binary decisions

![](includes/decision_tree.png)

## How it works?

1. Identify the variable that provides the most information gain when split on.

2. Split the dataset based on the chosen feature into two or more subsets.

3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each subset until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or the subsets being too small to split further.

4. At each leaf node, assign a class label based on the majority class of the data points in that node.

## Random Forest

Grow many decision trees using independent subsets of the data

Use the same criteria for constructing each tree

Average the prediction of all trees

This approach avoids over-fitting the data and improves accuracy when used to predict the class of new data

## Knowledge check

What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

A. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning does not.

B. Unsupervised learning requires labeled data, while supervised learning does not.

C. Both supervised and unsupervised learning require labeled data.

D. There is no difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Summary

Explore your data: descriptive statistics, plotting distributions, plotting correlations

Unsupervised learning methods like clustering can help you learn about patterns in your data

Supervised learning methods like regression and classification can help you explain relationships and predict outcomes of new data
