# Exploring your data

## Exploratory data analysis

What do we mean when we say *explore your data*?

$\rightarrow$ Gain familiarity with the contents of the data

$\rightarrow$ Identify questions that can be answered with the data

$\rightarrow$ Generate summary statistics (average, variance, min, max)

$\rightarrow$ Plot distributions and correlations between variables

# Let's look at an example: Grocery visitation data

## Gain familiarity with your data {.scrollable}

A good data source will provide information about a dataset in the form of a data dictionary.

A data dictionary is a comprehensive guide that provides detailed information to the data analyst about the dataset being analyzed.

Can include:

- Variable names

- Data types

- Descriptions

- Possible values

- Missing value indication

- Source

## Identify questions that could be asked

- Which stores have the greatest number of unique shoppers?

- What is the average length of time a shopper remains in a store?

- How far do shoppers travel to a store during a weekday?

- What time of day is the busiest time to shop on a Saturday and a Sunday?  


## Summary statistics {.scrollable}

Summary statistics provide an overview of the data's main characteristics.

They are important for understanding the data's scope and identifying possible outliers.

What summary statistics would we want to report if we were to answer the following question: **How far do shoppers travel to a store during a weekday?**

1. **Average distance (mean)**: Calculate the average distance traveled by all shoppers, conditioning on weekdays.

2. **Range of distances (min and max)**: Find the shortest and longest distances traveled by shoppers, conditioning on weekdays.

3. **Variation of distance traveled (standard deviation)**: This measures the amount of dispersion in the distances. A high standard deviation means that the distances vary widely from the mean, while low standard deviation means that the distances traveled are clustered closely around the mean.


## Plotting distributions and correlations

![](includes/ggpairs.png){fig-align="center"}

## Plotting distributions and correlations {.scrollable}

Plotting data allows you to see relationships in the data that cannot be easily identified with summary statistics.

We plot *distributions* for a single variable:

- Allows you to see patterns, anomalies, and spot outliers in the data

- The shape of the distribution informs whether you will need to transform the data (e.g., take the log)

We plot *correlations* between two variables:

- Discover relationships between two variables and use this to inform a hypothesis

- Highly correlated data can be problematic and plotting correlations can detect these relationships

# Cross-Sectional Data Analysis

## Cluster analysis

Last week, we discussed **cluster analysis** 

Cluster analysis is a form of *unsupervised learning* 

It provides a systematic method to look for patterns in data.

## Knowledge check

We discussed k-means clustering in class, and in lab. What is the main goal of the k-means clustering algorithm?

A) To minimize the distance between all data points in the dataset.

B) To minimize the distance between each data point and its assigned centroid.

C) To maximize the distance between each data point and all other data points.

D) To maximize the distance between each data point and its assigned centroid.

# Customer segmentation

## [ESRI Tapestry Segmentation](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/latest/regional-data/tapestry-segmentation.htm)

Uses cluster analysis on census demographic data (+ others) to define groups

![](includes/esri_tapestry.jpeg){fig-align="center"}



## Why segment your customers?

We live in a noisy world and crowded marketplace

People are getting better at ignoring and there are more niches

Increase the chances of of reaching the right customers with the right message at the right time

Increase sales, revenue, and hopefully profit


## How do you know if you are achieving your goal?

## Dimensions of customer segmentation

Identify customer personas

Customer stage - leads, prospects, existing customers

Customer demographics - age, gender, income, location, occupation,

Customer behaviors - purchase history, web browsing activity

## Customer segmentation analysis

A common application of cluster analysis is to use sales data to divide customers into groups to better target marketing



# Project 2 Datasets

## **LAUREN WORKING ON THESE NOW**


## Summary

Explore your data: descriptive statistics, plotting distributions, plotting correlations

Unsupervised learning methods like clustering can help you learn about patterns in your data

Supervised learning methods like regression and classification can help you explain relationships and predict outcomes of new data

## How does cluster analysis work? {.scrollable}

[K-means clustering](https://youtu.be/4b5d3muPQmA)

1. Choose the number of clusters (k) that you want to identify in the data.

2. Randomly initialize the k cluster centroids (points in space) within the data range.

3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, based on the Euclidean distance between the point and each centroid.

4. Calculate the mean (centroid) of each cluster based on the data points assigned to it.

5. Update the cluster centroids to be the means of the data points assigned to them.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until convergence (when the cluster assignments no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached).

Usually, we repeat this whole process a number of times and choose the group assignment that minimizes the overall variance

After clustering, summarize attributes of the clusters to understand the groups



# Supervised Learning

## Regression

Used to estimate relationships between inputs (independent, explanatory) and outputs (dependent, outcome)

## Example: Ice Cream Sales and Temperature

## Classification

Problem: we need to classify data into discrete units (e.g., images, product types, sentiment)^[Can also be used on continuous data]

We have some units labeled and know information about them (cats vs dogs)

We want to develop a model to classify new units based on observable attributes

## Spam email

## Decision Tree Classification

Classification as a sequence of binary decisions

![](includes/decision_tree.png)

## How it works?

1. Identify the variable that provides the most information gain when split on.

2. Split the dataset based on the chosen feature into two or more subsets.

3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each subset until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or the subsets being too small to split further.

4. At each leaf node, assign a class label based on the majority class of the data points in that node.

## Random Forest

Grow many decision trees using independent subsets of the data

Use the same criteria for constructing each tree

Average the prediction of all trees

This approach avoids over-fitting the data and improves accuracy when used to predict the class of new data

## Knowledge check

What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

A. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning does not.

B. Unsupervised learning requires labeled data, while supervised learning does not.

C. Both supervised and unsupervised learning require labeled data.

D. There is no difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
