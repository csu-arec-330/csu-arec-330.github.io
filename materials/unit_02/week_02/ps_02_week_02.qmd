<!-- AS OF SPRING 2025, LAUREN COMBINED PROBLEM SETS 2 AND 3 FOR PROJECT 02 (UNIT 02) -->
## Problem Set Overview

This problem set helps you continue analyzing your data and prepares you for your final Project 2 deliverables by guiding you through exploratory visualizations, cluster analysis, and interpreting results.

## Part 1: More Exploratory Data Analysis in R

Complete the following steps using your merged convenience store datasets (shopper_info.csv, gtin.csv, and store_info.csv):

1. Clearly document and justify **any further processing steps** you performed (e.g., handling missing data, dropping observations, transformations, aggregations) since project 02 - problem set 01. Write a concise narrative describing your decisions. A reader should be able to reproduce your steps based solely on your description.

2. Generate a `ggpairs` plot (i.e., the density and scatter plots) of your quantitative measures. Note that the visuals may be different for qualitative data. Interpret these visualizations clearly. Describe patterns, correlations, or other notable features you observe and explain their relevance to your analysis.

## Part 2: K-Means Cluster Analysis in R

Using your processed dataset, perform a K-means cluster analysis appropriate for your research question. Follow these steps clearly:

1. Explain which variables you chose for clustering and why these dimensions help answer your research question. Clearly interpret your resulting clusters. What insights or patterns do the clusters reveal?

2. Provide evidence supporting your choice of K (number of clusters). Include either a silhouette plot or elbow plot and explain your decision.

3. Summarize the variables you included in your cluster analysis for each cluster. Clearly discuss notable differences in variable means or distributions across clusters.

4. Export a dataset containing all variables used in your cluster analysis along with each observation's assigned cluster. Provide a narrative explaining your cluster analysis clearly on your webpage.

## Part 2: Tableau Visualizations

1. Create at least one Tableau visualization clearly illustrating insights from your exploratory analysis. Integrate relevant summary statistics directly into your Tableau visualization using the map Tooltip. 

2. Create TWO visualizations that show your clusters, exploring the underlying meaning of your clusters by seeing how clusters compare across the variables you used to define them (create scatter plots to show this). Use these visuals to support a description of each cluster. 

2. Discuss the practical takeaways for your research question based on your Tableau visualizations and clustering analysis. Clearly describe what your analysis uncovered.

## How to Submit

Create a new page on your Google Site titled `Project 2 Problem Set 2`. *Remember: Add this as a **new page** to your existing website. Do not create a new website.* 

This assignment has two components:

1. R code 

- Start with your R code from Problem Set 1. 
- Make any changes you to your code from Problem Set 1 based on feedback you received from Problem Set 1
- Add the `ggpairs()` visualizations and interpretation 
- Include comments throughout your code that describe each step

2. Tableau visualizations 

- EDA visualization 
- Two cluster visualizations with accompanying descriptions
- Clear takeaways related to your research question

Submit your webpage link on Canvas.

## Reminder: How to Use "Compile Report" Option in R

*Going going forward, please use the "Compile Report" process to submit your R code. We will no longer use "sink-source-sink".*

{{< video https://youtu.be/B2AchbhnFTo aspect-ratio="16x9" >}}

- Under the File menu, select **Compile Report...**
- The default under "Report output format" is HTML. 
- Select **Compile**
- Along the tool bar, select **Open in Browser**
- Hover your cursor over white space and **right click**.
- Select **View page source**.
- A new screen will appear with HTML code. (Don't worry, this might look like gibberish, but it's not!)
- Using your keyboard, click **`CTRL`+`A`**. This will highlight all of the HTML code.
- While the HTML code is highlighted, **right click** and select **Copy**.
- Go to your Google website. 
- Similar to as you would embed your Tableau visualization, select **Embed** under Insert.
- Then, select **Embed code**.
- Paste your embed code from your clipboard by either right-clicking and selecting **Paste** or `CTRL`+`V`.
- Select **Next**.
- **Resize** the image of your R script by expanding the window to fit the entire script.  

Following these steps will display your entire code and output without truncation.
