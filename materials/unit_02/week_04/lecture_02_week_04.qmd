## Before we Begin...

**Who Am I?** 

I am a researcher with expertise in the employment patterns of U.S. agricultural workers.

**Who Are You?** 

YOU are a group of government and non-profit employees from organizations like the [National Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Association](https://nmshsa.org), the [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/training/migrantfarmworkers), and the [CO Department of Labor and Employment](https://cdle.colorado.gov/jobs-training/find-a-job/migrant-seasonal-farmworkers).

## Why are we looking for migrant workers?

The U.S. government has a variety of publicly-funded programs aimed at helping migrant and seasonal agricultural workers...

- **Why** do these programs exist? 
  
  - Having a sufficient number of workers *when* and *where* they are needed is vital for our agricultural industry.

  - But agricultural workers face ["chronic seasonal unemployment and underemployment"](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/training/migrantfarmworkers)

## Why are we looking for migrant workers?

The U.S. government has a variety of publicly-funded programs aimed at helping migrant and seasonal agricultural workers...

- **What** programs exist?

  - [The National Farmworker Jobs Program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/agriculture)

  - [Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs](https://nmshsa.org/mshs-programs)

  - [Other Migrant Education programs](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-migrant-education/)

  - [Migrant Clinicians Network](https://www.migrantclinician.org)

## Why are we looking for migrant workers?

The U.S. government has a variety of publicly-funded programs aimed at helping migrant and seasonal agricultural workers...

But these programs have located offices and staffed according with historic migrant flows.

## Why are we looking for migrant workers?

The U.S. government has a variety of publicly-funded programs aimed at helping migrant and seasonal agricultural workers...

But these programs have located offices and staffed according with historic migrant flows.

<span style="color:green;">**And now they aren't successfully finding very many migrant workers.**</span>

**The Question:** 

*Where* and *when* can we 

find migrant ag workers?
:::

## How will we answer this Q? The Data.

[The National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/national-agricultural-workers-survey)

The only nationally-representative survey of U.S. agricultural workers

Workers are interviewed at their place of employment

  - This mitigates issues faced by household-based surveys in finding ag workers

**Workers provide their work history, including the county and dates of employment, for all jobs in the past year**

## How will we answer this Q? The Analysis

I will use a <span style="color:green;">**cluster**</span> analysis to answer this question.

**Why?** because I want to construct groups of counties that are "related" in terms of where groups of workers choose to work. 

I will call these clusters "labor sheds" and they represent geographical areas in which workers are willing to mgirate within to work farm jobs.

## How will we answer this Q? The Analysis

I will use a <span style="color:green;">**cluster**</span> analysis to answer this question.

**How?** first I will create a measure of how related/linked two counties are in terms of the number of workers who have worked in both counties. Geographers typically call this measure "proportional flow":

$$
\frac{C_{ij}}{\min\left( W_i, W_j \right)}
$$

Where $C_{ij}$ is the number of workers who worked in both county i and j and $W_i$, $W_j$ are the number of (distinct) workers who worked in county i, j

          data-background-interactive>
</section>


## How will we answer this Q? The Analysis

I will then use two variables to create clusters of counties that are "related"

  - proportional flow (the one I created) 

  - an indicator for whether two counties are adjacent

Finally, I will use information on the timing of employment to... 

  - understand when workers are working within each county 

  - assess whether workers within each cluster find year-round employment

## **Assumptions, limitations, and future work**

::: {.incremental}
1. Workers provide accurate information on their employment

2. Workers are more likely to migrate following a path of adjacent counties

3. The analysis only includes crop workers

4. Policy-makers need more refined geographical information than this to know where to locate offices, but this is not feasible with available data

5. Future work should conduct targeted surveys within labor sheds to locate specific agricultural areas and assess worker needs

**What to do with this information?** 

Policy-makers, non-profit employees, 

and other stakeholders (YOU!) 

can use my interactive maps to determine 

<span style="color:green;">*where*</span> to locate offices and <span style="color:green;">*when*</span> to staff them.

## 
::: {.r-fit-text}
**How can you use my maps to do this?** 

Within each labor shed, 

identify the counties that 

have the most workers each month.
