## Learning Objectives Tableau

- Understand Tableau geocoding capabilities

- Explain the different use cases of symbol and filled maps

- Create symbol and filled maps

- Customize Tableau maps

- Create visualizations to summarize individual-level data

- Aggregate individual level-data by geographic region


# Tableau

The defining characteristic of cross-sectional data is that we observe values of variables at a single point in, or cross-section of time. Often, but not always, cross-sectional data have geographic compenents that allows us to use Tableau's mapping features when creating visualizations. Effective analysis of cross-sectional data begins with estimating and conveying useful summary statistics. Today, we will spend most of our time discussing how to do this with spatial data.

### 1. Tableau's Geocoding

If you want to analyze your data geographically, you can plot your data on a map in Tableau.

When building map views, Tableau supports any latitude and longitude coordinates, as long as they are in decimal degrees. Tableau can also recognize and geocode the following geographic information types:

- Airport Codes

- Cities

- Countries

- Regions

- Territories

- States

- Provinces

- Postcodes

- Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs)

- Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)

- U.S. Area Codes

- Congressional Districts

- Zip Codes

If you have geographic delineations besides these, you will have to use crosswalks or some other means to convert the delineations to one of these forms, or to generate latitudes and longitudes for specific points (e.g., addresses).

### 2. Tableau's Spatial Data Capabilities

Tableau can also connect to the following spatial file types:

- Shapefiles

- KML files

- GeoJSON files

- TopoJSON files

- Esri File Geodatabases

These types of files include detailed geographic information that enables us to plot shapes and single points. For example, we can load smoke plume data into Tableau:

### 3. Symbol vs. Filled Maps

#### Symbol Maps

A symbol map is effective for showing quantitative data for individual locations. For example, you can use a symbol map to show individual store locations on a map.

You might want to highlight which stores have [higher spending](https://www.safegraph.com/data-examples/ohio-grocery-spend)

To create a symbol map, be sure your data source includes the following types of information:

- Quantitative values

- Latitude and longitude coordinates or geographic locations recognized by Tableau

Symbol maps work best with data containing large variations of values. Without enough variation, the symbols will appear approximately the same size in the view.

#### Filled Maps

A filled map is ideal when you want to show ratio data. For example, if you wanted to see the percent of total podcast downloads across the United States, you could use a filled map to show trends spatially.

To create a filled map, verify that your data source includes the following types of information:

- Quantitative or qualitative values

- Geographic locations recognized by Tableau or custom polygons (from a spatial data file)

**Knowledge Check 1:** Suppose we have county-level data on average gas prices last year. What type of map would you use to show this information?

**Knowledge Check 2:** Suppose we have gas station-level data on gas prices yesterday. What type of map would you use to show this information?
