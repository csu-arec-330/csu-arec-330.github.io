## What is cross sectional data?
::: {.incremental}

- Cross-sectional data is collected by observing a study population at a single point in time or for a period of time and aggregating information to a single observation per subject.

- We call it cross-sectional data because we are observing information for a slice, *snapshot*, or cross-section of a group subjects.

- This differs from time series data in that we only observe information at a single point in time.

## Analyzing Cross-Sectional Data

- Analyzing cross-section data typically consists of studying differences among subjects.

- We can use cross-sectional data to ask *frequency-type* questions: 

    - how common is the outcome? 

    - how many people are impacted? 

    - who is impacted?

- Or *association-type* questions:

    - what factors are associated with the outcome (age, gender, income, pollution, health, etc.)?

## Analyzing Cross-Sectional Data: Examples

- What is the association between average income and household food waste?

- How much do consumers spend on coffee products in a particular area? Does coffee spending differ by age?

- How could I use cross-sectional data to decide where to open a new grocery store? How many grocery stores are located in a particular area?

## What is time series data? {.scrollable}

Time series data is a sequence of data points collected over time. 

It typically consists of observations taken at regular intervals (e.g. every hour, every day, every week, etc.) and can be used to study trends and patterns over time.

# Project 1

## Project 1 overview

Groups of 2

Choose an ag biz or enre management question to answer with time series data

Collect time series data

Analyze trends 

Generate a forecast 

Present results in class Fri March 10


## Example: Corn and Combines {.scrollable}

:::
<!-- Historical corn prices and future equipment sales  -->

Context: Equipment dealers sell more when ag prices rise.  Most people grow corn near dealer x.

Question: Will corn prices rise or fall in the next year and by how much?

Approach: Analyze time series of corn prices (decomp).  Forecast corn PPI one year.

Present: Provide context (plot raw data) and describe decision. Explain your insights.  Use effective graphics. Tell your data story.


## Finding data

Many sources of public data (e.g., [St Louis FED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33528), [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/))

Choose data appropriate to answer the question 

Ali and Jude can help



## Analysis

Must include some:

- time series analysis (unit 1 week 2)

- forecasting (unit 2 week 3)

## Process

Identify an interesting question

Collect data

Develop analysis strategy, explore, refine

Develop presentation
