## Motivation

Our goal in this course is to teach the tools and the process of analyzing data to inform decisions

You now have some tools for data analysis

Today, let's revisit the process.

How do we get from question to answer?

## Agenda

## Where should we open a grocery store in AZ? {.scrollable}

From Chat GPT

The ideal location for a grocery store in Arizona depends on various factors such as population density, demographics, competition, accessibility, and local zoning laws. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a location for a grocery store in Arizona:

Population density: Look for areas with a high population density, as this is likely to increase foot traffic to the store.

Demographics: Consider the demographics of the area you are targeting, such as age, income, and household size. These factors will affect what types of products will sell well in your store.

Competition: Analyze the competition in the area, including the number and types of grocery stores, to determine the level of demand for a new store in the area.

Accessibility: Consider the accessibility of the location, such as its proximity to major roads and public transportation. This can affect the convenience of shopping for customers.

Local zoning laws: Check local zoning laws to ensure that the location you choose is zoned for commercial use and that there are no restrictions on operating a grocery store in the area.

Some potential locations to consider for a grocery store in Arizona could include areas with growing populations, such as Phoenix, Tucson, and Mesa, or areas with a high concentration of college students, such as Tempe. Ultimately, conducting thorough research and analyzing the factors above can help you make an informed decision about the best location for your grocery store in Arizona.

## Refining the question

How can we improve our current question: Where should we open a grocery store in AZ?

Normative. Can we clarify our objective?
<!-- Where would opening a grocery store in AZ generate the most profit in 30 years? -->

Spatial scope. Can we clarify the spatial unit of analysis?
<!-- In which county would opening a grocery store in AZ generate the most profit in 30 years? -->

## Refining the question

Normative. Can we clarify our objective?

- Where would opening a grocery store in AZ generate the most profit in 30 years?

Spatial scope. Can we clarify the spatial unit of analysis?

- In which county would opening a grocery store in AZ generate the most profit in 30 years?

## Conceptual framework 

:::{.incremental}

How do the economics work in this context?  What should influence grocery store profitability?

- Profit = Revenue - Costs

- Sales/revenue: people shop for groceries where convenient; they may be willing to travel further or pay more for specialty items; groceries are generally normal goods so more income -> more sales

- Cost: labor costs may be higher in higher income areas; land/building rental rates, taxes and operating expenses (power, water)

## Data

- Grocery stores

- Population 

- Income

- Unemployment rate

- Land area

## EDA (Cluster Analysis)

Let's explore the data with a cluster analysis

Also, if your study industry or market is not in (or close) to equilibrium, cluster analysis may help identify areas with opportunities

3 clusters on: stores, population, income, land area, unemployment

## Store Number and Population

![](includes/Store Number x Pop 2020.png)

## Store Number and Unemployment

![](includes/Store Number x Unemployment percent.png)


## Store Number and Land Area

![](includes/Store Number x Land Area sq mi.png)



## Analysis

Regression model to establish relationship between an areas population, income, and grocery stores

We are assuming that the current markets are near equilibrium - there are currently the *right* number of stores based on population and income

$GS_i = \beta_1 pop_i + \beta_2 income_i + \beta_3 unemp_i + \beta_4 area_i + \varepsilon_i$

Which of the covariates is statistically significant at $\alpha=0.05$?

## How well does the model fit the data? How do you know?

## Application

Use population and income projections to estimate opportunities for expansion

$$ forGS_i = \hat{\beta_1} 2050pop_i + \hat{\beta_2} income_i + \hat{\beta_3} unemp_i + \hat{\beta_4} area_i $$

Identify growth potential as counties where increased population increases equilibrium number of stores

$$ forGS_i - GS_i $$

## Expand stores where gap is blue
