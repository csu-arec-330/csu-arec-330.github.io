## Motivation

Our goal in this course is to teach tools and processes for analyzing data to inform decision-making.

You now have some tools for data analysis.

Today, let's revisit the process.

How do we get from question to answer?

## Agenda 

Finding patterns in convenience store sales

Project 2: Q\&A


# Project Context

## Who am I? {.scrollable}

I'm a researcher interested in **store-level variation** in product offerings, consumer behavior, and store performance across the U.S. convenience store sector. 

I focus on how retail format, customer base, and product mix interact across locations.

## Who are you?

**Scenario**: A supplier of packaged snacks or beverages wants to know which types of stores would be best targets for a new product line.

## What is my research question? {.scrollable}

**Can we identify meaningful segments of convenience stores based on transaction-level data?**

This leads to sub-questions like:

- Are there distinguishable store clusters based on number of customers, product diversity, and fuel share?

- How do consumer shopping patterns vary across those clusters?

- How are clusters positioned across the United States?

## Why does it matter? {.scrollable}

Understanding store segments helps us:

- Identify business strategies that different store types pursue (e.g., fuel-heavy vs. product-diverse)

- Highlight variation in access to different products, which matters for consumer choice

- Support targeted business decisions, like vendor partnerships or tailored promotions

- Potentially link to spatial inequities in access to goods and services

## How do I answer it? {.scrollable}

I use a cluster analysis of national convenience store data:

- **Data**: Transaction-level data linked to store and product characteristics

- **Variables**: Total sales, unique customers, product diversity, fuel share, and chain size

- **Method**: K-means clustering on log-transformed and scaled variables

- **Interpretation**: Examine features of each cluster to understand differences in store types


# EDA (Cluster Analysis)

## Read In Data {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: false

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(factoextra)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
```
```{r}
#| echo: true

# Read in the shopper_info dataset
# This dataset contains detailed information on shoppers and their transactions for July 2023
shopper_info <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_02/inputs/shopper_info.csv")

# Separate data file with shopper ID and their zipcode
shopper_zip <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_02/inputs/shopper_zip.csv")

# Read in the GTIN dataset
# This file links products to their Global Trade Item Numbers, akin to SKUs or UPCs
gtin <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_02/inputs/gtin.csv")

# Read in the store_info dataset
# Contains details about each store, linkable to shopper_info via store_id
store_info <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_02/inputs/store_info.csv")
```

## Clean the Data {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Join the data frames together
store_shopper_gtin_left <- left_join(store_info, shopper_info, by = "store_id") %>%
  left_join(gtin, by = "gtin")

# Look at the raw count of observations after join
total_observations <- nrow(store_shopper_gtin_left)
print(paste0("Total observations of raw data: ", total_observations))

# Look at the number of distinct store id's prior to cleaning the data
store_count_raw <- length(unique(store_shopper_gtin_left$store_id))
print(paste0("Count of distinct stores in raw data: ", store_count_raw))

# Clean and transform the raw data
clean_data <- store_shopper_gtin_left %>%

    # Remove observations with negative or zero unit price (e.g., returns or invalid entries)
  filter(unit_price > 0) %>% 
  
  # Remove observations of stores missing shopper IDs
  filter(!is.na(shopper_id)) %>%
  
  # Calculate total spending per line item
  mutate(total = unit_price * unit_quantity) %>%
  
  # Convert transaction_set_id and transaction_item_id to integers without decimals
  mutate(transaction_set_id = format(transaction_set_id, scientific = FALSE, trim = TRUE), 
         transaction_item_id = format(transaction_item_id, scientific = FALSE, trim = TRUE)) %>%
  
  # Arrange data by store_id and zip_code
  arrange(store_id, zip_code)
```

## What is my Unit of Analysis? {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Check how many distinct shoppers are in the clean dataset
unit_of_analysis <- length(unique(clean_data$store_id))
print(paste0("Unit of analysis (store-level): ", unit_of_analysis))
```

## Cluster Analysis Setup {.scrollable}

I want to analyze stores using:

- Unique customers  
- Total sales  
- Product diversity  
- Fuel share  
- Chain size  

I need to summarize these metrics to the **store-level** as this is my unit of analysis.

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Summarize metrics at the store level
store_summary <- clean_data %>%
  group_by(store_id) %>%
  summarise(
    total_sales = sum(unit_price * unit_quantity, na.rm = TRUE),               # Total revenue
    unique_customers = n_distinct(shopper_id),                                 # Number of unique customers
    product_diversity = n_distinct(gtin),                                      # Number of unique products sold
    fuel_transactions = sum(is.na(gtin) | gtin == 0),                          # Number of fuel transactions
    total_transactions = n_distinct(transaction_set_id),                       # Total number of transactions
    fuel_share = fuel_transactions / total_transactions,                       # Fuel share of transactions
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  left_join(store_info %>% select(store_id, chain_size), by = "store_id") %>%      # Add chain size
  filter(!is.na(chain_size))

# Final dataset: merge summaries if desired
final_dataset <- store_summary %>%
  left_join(store_info %>% select(-chain_size), by = c("store_id")) %>%
  arrange(store_id, zip_code)
```

## Summary Stats {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

sumstats <- store_summary %>%
  summarise(
    mean_sales = mean(total_sales),
    mean_customers = mean(unique_customers),
    mean_products = mean(product_diversity),
    mean_fuel_share = mean(fuel_share),
    mean_chain_size = mean(chain_size),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

print(sumstats, n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

## Log-Transformations {.scrollable}

Because these variables are very skewed, I log-transform `unique_customers`, `total_sales`, `product_diversity`, and `chain_size`.

```{r}
#| echo: true

# I noticed that the distribution of my store attributes is very skewed, so I want to rescale them.
final_dataset <- final_dataset %>%
  mutate(
    log_customers = log(unique_customers + 1),
    log_sales = log(total_sales + 1),
    log_products = log(product_diversity + 1),
    log_chain_size = log(chain_size + 1)
  )
```

## GGPairs Plot

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Run the ggpairs() command
final_dataset %>%
  select(log_customers, log_sales, log_products, fuel_share, log_chain_size) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

## Almost there... Need to rescale variables {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Prepare data for clustering
cluster_data <- final_dataset %>%
  select(log_customers, log_sales, log_products, fuel_share, log_chain_size)

cluster_scaled <- scale(cluster_data)
```

## Choosing the Number of Clusters {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Use two common methods to help choose the number of clusters.

# Elbow Method
fviz_nbclust(cluster_scaled, kmeans, method = "wss")

# Silhouette Method
fviz_nbclust(cluster_scaled, kmeans, method = "silhouette")
```


## Perform Clustering and Add to Data {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Perform k-means clustering on logged and scaled data
set.seed(123)
kmeans_fit <- kmeans(cluster_scaled, centers = 4, nstart = 25)

# Add cluster to dataset
final_dataset$cluster <- factor(kmeans_fit$cluster)
```

## Visualizing the Clusters {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true

fviz_cluster(kmeans_fit, data = cluster_scaled, geom = "point", ellipse.type = "norm")
```


## Compare Cluster Averages

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Use the original (non-logged) variables because you're summarizing actual store characteristics — not the transformed versions.
final_clusters <- final_dataset %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarize(across(c(unique_customers, total_sales, product_diversity, fuel_share, chain_size), mean))

print(final_clusters)
```

## Most Frequent City by Cluster {.scrollable}

**What are the top 5 cities where stores of each cluster are located?**

```{r}
#| echo: true

final_dataset %>%
  select(cluster, city) %>%
  group_by(cluster, city) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 5) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  kable()
```

## Cluster 1: Fuel-Dominant, Low-Volume Stores {.scrollable}

**These stores are primarily fuel-oriented, with minimal in-store shopping. Likely located in rural or highway areas.**

- Very few customers (~1.63)

- Low sales (~$163)

- Very limited product variety (~1.36)

- Fuel share > 1 (likely a data artifact, possibly due to fuel-only transactions dominating the count)


## Mid-Volume, High-Diversity Stores {.scrollable}

**These stores show a more balanced customer base and diverse product offerings, suggesting a hybrid model of fuel + general merchandise.**

- Moderate customers (~5.53)

- Strong sales (~$1,796)

- High product diversity (~6.81)

- High fuel share (~89%)

## Cluster 3: High-Volume, High-Sales Stores {.scrollable}

**These stores are top performers in both customer traffic and revenue. Possibly urban or destination stores with strong retail and fuel performance.**

- Most customers (~19.79)

- Highest sales (~$3,641)

- Moderately high product diversity (~4.78)

- High fuel share (~94%)

## Cluster 4: Low-Volume, Non-Fuel Stores {.scrollable}

**These appear to be underperforming stores with limited traffic, low sales, and minimal fuel activity. May represent struggling or niche-format stores.**

- Fewest customers (~1.25)

- Lowest sales (~$17.90)

- Low product diversity (~2.38)

- Very low fuel share (~6.5%)

## Revisiting the Research Question {.scrollable}

**Can we identify meaningful segments of convenience stores based on transaction-level data?**

Answer: Yes!

- The clusters suggest four distinct operational models among stores in the dataset.
- These segments differ in customer base, sales volume, product assortment, and fuel reliance — reflecting meaningful variation in store strategy and performance.

Why it matters:

- Product suppliers may target Clusters 2 and 3 with expanded assortments or promotions.

- Clusters 1 and 4 may signal opportunities for format innovation, operational improvement, or market exit.

- Retailers can use this segmentation to prioritize investments, tailor inventory strategies, and benchmark performance.

## Analysis

Regression model to establish relationship between an areas population, income, and grocery stores

We are assuming that the current markets are near equilibrium - there are currently the *right* number of stores based on population and income

$GS_i = \beta_1 pop_i + \beta_2 income_i + \beta_3 unemp_i + \beta_4 area_i + \varepsilon_i$

## Application

Use population and income projections to estimate opportunities for expansion

$$ forGS_i = \hat{\beta_1} 2050pop_i + \hat{\beta_2} income_i + \hat{\beta_3} unemp_i + \hat{\beta_4} area_i $$

Identify growth potential as counties where increased population increases equilibrium number of stores

$$ forGS_i - GS_i $$

## Expand stores where gap is blue
