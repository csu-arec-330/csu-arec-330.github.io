## Problem Set Overview

This problem set introduces you to spatial data in R.

## Part 1: Spatial data in R -- DO NOT DO PART 1!!

1. Use one of your project datasets that contains spatial information (or find a new one). Convert it to a spatially aware `sf` object.

2. Perform a spatial intersection associating data from another source with your data. 

## Part 2: Project data analysis in R

1. Using your project datasets, perform either a regression or cluster analysis as appropriate for your research question or objective. (This can be the same analysis from last week's problem set.)

**IF using regression analysis** 

2. Perform a multivariate regression, copy and paste your regression output into your google site and briefly describe the results - interpret the coefficients and discuss overall model fit.
   
3. Use future predicted values for one of the variables in your regression analysis (e.g., population...) to forecast values of your outcome variable. 
  
4. Create and export a dataset that includes the actual and predicted values of this variable.

**IF using cluster analysis** 

2. Summarize the variables you included in your cluster analysis for each cluster. Discuss the results, including any notable differences between the variables across clusters. 

3. Export a dataset that includes all variables you used in your cluster analysis, as well as your clusters.

## Part 3: Analysis and Visualizations in Tableau

1. **IF using regression analysis** Create TWO visualizations that shows the difference between the observed and future values of your outcome variable. 

1. **IF using cluster analysis** Create TWO visualizations that help you assign meaning to your clusters. Note that if the clusters you generated in R turn out to not be useful, you can use Tableau's clustering analysis to change the variables or number of clusters to find more useful groupings. 

2. Discuss take-aways for your research question based on your analysis. What did your analysis uncover?

## How to Submit

You should create a new webpage on your google site titled `Project 2 Problem Set 3`. Parts 1 and 2 should include your annotated code. Part 2 should additionally include your regression output or summary statistics from your cluster analysis and the accompanying discussions. Part 3 should include your two data visualizations and a disucssion of your findings. Submit the link to your google site webpage in Canvas.
