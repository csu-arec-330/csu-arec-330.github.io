  - Staggered treatment times

- Create visualizations for panel data analysis: 

  - Maps and pages 

  - Visualizing temporal variation


# Tableau 

Panel data is a type of longitudinal data that involves the collection of observations on the same individuals or units over time. This makes panel data different from cross-sectional data, which involves the collection of observations on different individuals or units at a single point in time, and time series data, which involves the collection of observations on the same variable over time.

The objective of this lab is to show you how to create effective visualizations for your panel data analysis. We have touched on how to create all of these visualizations in prior labs, so today our focus will be less on the procedures for creating visualizations and more on ideas for tailoring these vizzes to panel data. 

## Difference in differences

The classic DiD visualization looks something like this:

## Fixed effects with marginal changes

This section will cover how to estimate marginal changes with fixed effects and panel data. In this case, the goal is to use the fixed effects to control for unmeasured differences between the units that do not change over time (generally called unobserved heterogeneity).

This exercise will use fixed effects models to analyze the impact of monthly fuel moisture on monthly wildfire activity in select counties in the US.^[I removed counties that never experienced any fire between 2006-2015.] You can download the data from [this folder](https://colostate-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jbayham_colostate_edu/EgFfaomIJ8VOoPLiTz6YXfEBXQqoY1eiOuDmpPpur7f9Ow?e=zDMuWi). The folder contains two files: 1) `fires_303.csv.gz` and 2) `weather_303.csv.gz`.  `fires_303.csv.gz` contains three variables: 1) a unique county identifier, `county_fips`, 2) the observation date `measure_date`, and 3) the number of wildfire burning on that date in that county, `fires`.  `weather_303.csv.gz` contains the same county and date information along with 1000-hour fuel moisture measured in percent from 1 to 40.^[1000-Hour Fuel Moisture (1000-hr FM) represents the modeled moisture content in dead fuels in the 3 to 8 inch diameter class and the layer of the forest floor about four inches below the surface. The 1000-hr FM value is based on a running 7-day computed average using length of day, daily temperature and relative humidity extremes (maximum and minimum values) and the 24-hour precipitation duration values. Values can range from 1 to 40 percent ([source](https://gacc.nifc.gov/nrcc/predictive/fuels_fire-danger/psa_component_glossary.htm)).] 

Start a new script. Download these data and read the datasets into R - call the dataframes `fire` and `weather`.  Note, the datasets for this exercise are fairly large.

### Data processing

The first issue is that the data we want to analyze are in two separate dataframes. We need to join the datasets to construct a single dataframe with both the fire occurrence and fuel moisture. 

The second issue is that the data you are given is at the daily level, but we want to analyze the relationship between fires and fuel moisture at the monthly level. We need to aggregate or summarize the data by month (use the function `yearmonth()` from the package `tsibble`). Let's `sum()` the number of `fires` and calculate the `mean()` of `fm1000`.


### Analysis

Our goal is to estimate the relationship between fuel moisture and the number of fire days across counties in the lower 48 states. In this case, the direction of causality is intuitive; dry hot weather dries out fuel and makes wildfire more likely. However, by estimating the model on all (fire prone) counties over time allows us to estimate the average effect over space and time (we also have the ability to estimate the relationship for any single county or point in time).

We will use the function `feols` from the `fixest` package to estimate our fixed-effects regression. When we have a large number of units and time periods, creating a bunch of dummy variables is a lot of work for the computer.  It turns out that subtracting the mean value of all variables along the dimensions of the fixed effects accomplishes the same thing.^[For example, subtracting the average of all variables across time, removes the county dummy variables since they don't vary over time]. This trick saves the computer a lot of work.

We want to estimate the model:
$$ fires_{it} = \beta fm1000_{it} + \gamma_t + \delta_i +\varepsilon_{it} $$
where, again, the $i$ and $t$ represent county and time, $\gamma_t$ are the time fixed effects, and $\delta_i$ are the county fixed effects, and $\beta$ is the coefficient of interest. In this project, $t$ represents the year-month. The fixed effects play a similar role in this regression. The county fixed effects control for time-invariant factors of a county like vegetation, elevation, etc. The time fixed effects control for nationwide changes in a given month that may impact fires. For example, an announcement by the USFS that all fires will be contained as quickly as possible. The idea is that we net those factors captured by the fixed effects out of the effect of fuel moisture so that we are left with a more credible estimate.

We enter the formula in `feols` similar to `lm()`, with a notable difference: the variables listed after the vertical pipe, $|$, are considered fixed effects.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# fixed effect regression model using fixest
m1 <- feols(fires ~ fm1000 | county_fips + ym,data = analysis_ds )
```

Use `summary()` to view the results. By default, model objects from `fixest` do not print the values of the fixed effects (though they can be recovered). Also, `fixest` provides its own function to view tables called `etable()`.

>What is the sign and magnitude of $\beta$? What does this tell us about the effect of fuel moisture on the number of fires in a county?


## Summary

This lab covered two ways of using fixed-effects regression models to analyze the causal impact of a policy or exposure. The methods are nearly identical in both cases.  The difference in the two examples described is the nature of the variable of interest. In the minimum wage example, the policy is binary, so the treatment effect is a discrete jump. In the case of fuel moisture and fire, fuel moisture is a continuous variable, so the effect is interpreted as a marginal change in fire day due to a one uit (percent) change in fuel moisture.
