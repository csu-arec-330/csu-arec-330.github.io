**The Question:** Your question for Project 3 should be formulated as: 

What is the association between $x$ (an explanatory variable) and $y$ (some outcome)?

**The Data:** You will use the convenience store data (shopper_info, store_info, gtin) to select your $y$, and choose **one** of the two additional datasets (census data or weather data) to choose your $x$.
 
- **Option 1:** Convenience store data combined with Demographic data from the US Census

- **Option 2:** Convenience store data combined with Weather data from NOAA

# Understanding Gas Prices in Our Community: <br>A Town Hall Discussion

## Presentation Components

1. Introduction, Question, Background

2. Data and Analysis

3. Discussion and Conclusion

# 1. Introduction, Question, Background

## Introduction {.smaller}

Good evening. I'm Lauren, a local economic analyst.

We're here today because the community needs to consider adding a new access road to Highway 101.

There is room in the town's budget for infrastructure improvements, but there is a concern that developing new roads might lead to higher fuel costs.

Tonight, I'll present to you analysis my team and I conducted on how gas prices vary with distance to the highway. 

**Decision Needed:** To better understand the trade-offs involved with improving highway access so that you, the town planning committee, can decide to add a new access road.

## Question {.larger}

How does the distance to the nearest highway relate to the price of gas paid by consumers?

## Why Does It Matter? 

As we consider building a new access road to Highway 101, it's important to understand the broader implications for our community—especially how it might affect gas prices.

If gas stations located closer to highway access charge more, then adding a new access point could inadvertently **raise fuel costs** for residents.

This analysis helps us weigh the **potential economic benefit to consumers** against the **infrastructure costs**, giving the town planning committee better information to guide your decision.


## Background {.scrollable}

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2em;">

<div style="flex: 1;">

### Concerns about re-routing the highway

- Could create more traffic for the town  
- Could lead to an increase in gas prices (gas stations could charge a higher price due to proximity to the highway)

</div>

<div style="flex: 1;">

### Benefits of re-routing the highway

- Shorter commuting time for residents  
- Better-conditioned road which offers ancillary benefits  
- More tax revenue from more gas sales

</div>

</div>

# 2. Data and Analysis

## Analysis Plan {.scrollable}

In order to answer our question: **How does the distance to the nearest highway relate to the price of gas paid by consumers?** we need data on the following:

- Location of gas stations (unit of analysis)

- Price of gas (outcome variable)

- Distance between gas station and the nearest highway (variable of interest)

These will serve as inputs into my linear regression model.

## Data Collection {.scrollable}

1. Location of gas stations ($i$)

- We gathered data on U.S. convenience stores with gas stations (`store_info`)

2. Price of gas ($pr_i$)

- We also have data on the price per gallon of gas for all transactions during the month of July 2023 (`shopper_info`)

$\rightarrow$ Using these datasets, we filter out only the convenience stores with a gas station, leaving a sample of conveniences stores that sell gas and the price at which they sell it.

## Data Collection {.scrollable}

3. Distance between gas stations and the nearest highway ($Dist_i$)

$\rightarrow$  For each convenience store with a gas station, we calculated the distance to the nearest highway and removed stores located further than 40 kilometers away (about 25 mi).

# Add this count as a new column to the sf object

## Distribution of Unit Price and Distance

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Filter dataset to keep only stores within 40 km of a major road
store_dist_40 <- store_dist %>%
  filter(dist < 40) %>%
  inner_join(select(stores_within,-unit_price),by="store_id")

ggpairs(store_dist_40, columns = 2:3)

```

## Unit prices appear to decrease as distance to highway increases

Figure 2: Scatter plot of unit price and distance
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Scatter plot of unit prices and distance
ggplot(store_dist_40, aes(x = dist, y = unit_price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Univariate Regression Analysis {.smaller}

Although we can draw loose insights from the scatter plot, we use regression analysis to determine the relationship between distance and price. 

$$ pr_{i} = \beta \cdot Dist_{i} + \alpha + \varepsilon_{i} $$

- Outcome: price per gallon

- Explanatory variable: distance to the highway (in kilometers)

- Unit of observation: convenience stores with gas pumps

## Univariate Regression Results {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Estimate linear regression of unit_price on distance
reg1 <- lm(unit_price ~ dist, data = store_dist_40) 

# Extract model results
results_df <- broom::tidy(reg1, conf.int = TRUE)

# Extract model statistics
model_stats <- glance(reg1) %>%
  select(r.squared, nobs) %>%
  rename(`R-squared` = r.squared, `Observations` = nobs) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "term", values_to = "estimate")

# Combine coefficients and model stats
results_combined <- bind_rows(results_df, model_stats)

# Display table
kable(results_combined, format = "html", caption = "Table 2: Regression Results for Unit Price vs. Distance")

# Convert results to wide format if necessary or customize the table manually
# kable(results_df, format = "html", caption = "Table 2: Regression Results for Unit Price vs. Distance")

```

Our analysis shows a clear trend—each kilometer away from the highway corresponds with a decrease in gas prices. (Refer to next slide.)

We also see that the $R^2$ value is low at 1.69%, which suggests we should include additional variables.

## For each additional km away from the highway, unit prices decrease by $0.005 cents per gallon

#| echo: false

ggplot(store_dist_40, aes(x = dist, y = unit_price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Distance and Unit Price",
       x = "Distance from Highway (km)",
       y = "Unit Price (cents per gallon)") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Multivariate Regression Analysis {.smaller}

After adding additional control variables, we want to test if our results still hold.

$$ pr_{i} = \beta_1 \cdot Dist_{i} + \beta_2 \cdot X_{i} + \alpha + \varepsilon_{i} $$

- Outcome: price per gallon

- Explanatory variable: distance to the highway (in kilometers)

- Additional control: number of gas stations within 5 kilometers (a proxy for competitiveness)

- Unit of observation: convenience stores with gas pumps


## Multivariate Regression Results {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Estimate linear regression of unit_price on distance
reg2 <- lm(unit_price ~ dist + count_within, data = store_dist_40) 

# Extract model results
results_df <- broom::tidy(reg2, conf.int = TRUE)

# Extract model statistics
model_stats <- glance(reg2) %>%
  select(r.squared, nobs) %>%
  rename(`R-squared` = r.squared, `Observations` = nobs) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "term", values_to = "estimate")

# Combine coefficients and model stats
results_combined <- bind_rows(results_df, model_stats)

# Display table
kable(results_combined, format = "html", caption = "Table 3: Regression Results for Unit Price vs. Distance and Number of Competitors")

# Convert results to wide format if necessary or customize the table manually
# kable(results_df, format = "html", caption = "Table 3: Regression Results for Unit Price vs. Distance and Number of Competitors")

```

Although our model fit improved (1.7%), the p-value associated with the number of gas stations within 5 km is not statistically significant, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is different from zero.

However, the coefficient on distance ($\beta_1$) remains statistically significant, suggesting the results are robust.

# 3. Discussion and Conclusion

## Takeaways

Our analysis shows consistent results between distance and unit price-each kilometer away from the highway corresponds with a decrease in gas prices.

Adding a control variable that attempts to capture competition (number of gas stations within 5 km) does not explain variation in unit prices.


## Assumptions and Limitations {.smaller}

Assumptions:

- We assume that a gas station will locate along the new highway access road (once it is built) near the highway to attract traffic flow from Highway 101.

- We assume that gas stations compete uniformly along prices of their grades of gasoline.


Limitations:

- We use distance "as the crow flies" versus travel distance along the road.

- We do not account for other confounding factors that could influence gas prices, such as the traffic flow on Highway 101 nearest to the town and distance to the nearest major metropolitan area.


## Discussion

The pattern we observe (inverse relationship between distance and price) suggests that stations closer to the highway charge a premium for the convenience of being located near the highway.

For those commuting to work places outside of town, this might mean higher travel expenses.

## Annual Economic Impact (on average)

**What would the impact of a half-cent per km increase in gas price be on a typical household?**

- Coefficient: \$0.005 (per 1 KM) = \$0.008 (per 1 MI)
- Fuel economy of a standard sedan: 30 miles per gallon
- Annual driving distance: 13,500 miles (US average, per FHWA)

*How much more would a household spend on fuel if their nearest gas station is 3 miles closer to the highway?*

## Annual Economic Impact (on average)

1. Change in price per gallon

- Assume 3 miles difference in distance to the highway:
- 3 miles $\times$ \$0.008 per mile = \$0.024 (2.4 cents)

2. Gallons used annually

- 13,500 miles / 30 mpg = 450 gallons/year

3. Annual cost impact

- \$0.024 $\times$ 450 gallons = **\$10.80 per year**

## Conclusion

Our analysis confirms that distance from the highway is a factor related to gas prices in our community.

However, the considering the current travel cost to the highway without the access road, offsets the modest expected increase in gas prices.

## As you prepare to vote tonight

Consider that building the access road could offer long-term savings for many households, even if prices near the highway remain slightly elevated.

Possible ways to balance these outcomes:

- Organize carpooling or shuttle programs to reduce fuel usage.
- Encourage local gas stations to adopt loyalty programs or price-matching to stay competitive.

**Ultimately, this decision is about access, affordability, and how we support our community's everyday needs.**

- Effective and appropriate data visualizations

- Data storytelling

- Scripted data management and analysis (in R)


## Organization

- Time series

- Cross sectional and spatial data

- Regression analysis 

What methods did we cover in these areas?



<!-- ## What is the purpose of decomposing a time series into its components? -->

<!-- A. To remove any anomalies or outliers from the data. -->

<!-- B. To prepare the data for regression analysis. -->

<!-- C. To determine the forecast accuracy of the time series. -->

<!-- D. To identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. -->

<!-- Answer D

Explanation: Decomposing a time series into its components is primarily done to understand and identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, including trends, seasonal variations, and irregular components. This process allows analysts to better understand the time series dynamics and can aid in improving forecasting models by clarifying what influences the data's movements over time.

-->

<!-- ## When is clustering analysis an appropriate technique for data analysis? -->

<!-- A. When the data is unlabeled or unstructured. -->

<!-- B. When the data has a clear target variable or outcome. -->

<!-- C. When the data has a linear relationship between variables. -->

<!-- D. When the data is in a time series format. -->

<!-- Answer A

Explanation: Clustering analysis is particularly suitable when you are dealing with unlabeled or unstructured data, as it helps to identify inherent groupings or patterns within the data without any prior labels. This technique is used to explore data and discover natural segments, groups, or classes by analyzing the structure based solely on the properties of the data.

-->


<!-- ## Which of the following analysis techniques is regression *not* suitable for? -->

<!-- A. Predicting a continuous outcome based on multiple input variables. -->

<!-- B. Estimating the effect of price changes on sales volume. -->

<!-- C. Analyzing the relationship between temperature and energy consumption. -->

<!-- D. Identifying distinct clusters of customers based on shopping behavior. -->

<!-- Answer: D 

Explanation: Regression analysis is used to model and predict continuous outcomes, estimate effects, and analyze relationships between variables. It is not suitable for identifying clusters, which is a task for cluster analysis techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering that are designed to detect patterns and groupings in data.

-->

<!-- ## How can color be used effectively in a data visualization? -->

<!-- A. To highlight important data points or trends. -->

<!-- B. To make the visualization more visually appealing. -->

<!-- C. To confuse the viewer with too many colors. -->

<!-- D. To distract from the key message of the visualization. -->
