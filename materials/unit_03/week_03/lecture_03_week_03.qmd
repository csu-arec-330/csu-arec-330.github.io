## [Project Overview](project_3.html) {.scrollable}


Choose one of the "treatment" datasets and find an outcome to evaluate

What is the impact of $x$ (treatment or exposure) on some outcome $y$?

Collect panel data and build dataset. Aggregate to the lowest common unit of analysis (e.g., county year). Merge data.

Perform an exploratory data analysis and assemble summary statistics. Analyze spatial patterns, correlations, etc. Estimate the effect of $x$ on $y$. Build visualizations to answer your research question.

Present results in class on final (May 10 9-11 AM). 

Incorporate feedback into report due Thursday May 11.

## Bats and Ag Land Prices ([Manning & Ando](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/720303))

![](includes/09-bats-1024x659.jpeg)

## Research Question

:::{.incremental}
- What effect do bats have on crop production (e.g., corn and soy beans)?

  - No good measure of bats, but we know white nose syndrome (WNS) kills bats
  
  - WNS is monitored by county over time

- What effect does white nose syndrome have on production, and land values?
:::

## What data would you collect?

iclicker short answer

:::{.incremental}
- Outcomes: cash rents, cropland acres

- Treatment: presence of white nose syndrome

- Controls: population, land quality, weather

- Unit of observation: county-year

## How would you specify the regression model?

Think about it.  I'll pick someone to write it on the board.

:::{.incremental}

- $$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$
:::

## Which coefficient answers the research question?

$$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$

A. $\beta$

B. $\gamma$

C. $\delta_t$

D. $\alpha_i$

## What is the role of $\alpha_i$ in the regression?

$$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$

A. To capture the average treatment effect of white nose syndrome on ag land prices

B. To capture unobserved factors in a county that do not vary over time

C. To capture unobserved factors common to all counties at a given point in time

D. To control for federal agricultural policies that may change over time

# Results

# Course Review

## What was this course about?

## Topics and themes

- Effective and appropriate data visualizations

- Data storytelling

- Scripted data management and analysis (in R)


## Organization

- Time series

- Cross sectional and spatial data

- Panel data

What methods did we cover in these areas?



## What is the purpose of decomposing a time series into its components?

A. To remove any anomalies or outliers from the data.

B. To prepare the data for regression analysis.

C. To determine the forecast accuracy of the time series.

D. To identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.


## When is clustering analysis an appropriate technique for data analysis?

A. When the data is unlabeled or unstructured.

B. When the data has a clear target variable or outcome.

C. When the data has a linear relationship between variables.

D. When the data is in a time series format.


## Which of the following analysis techniques is regression *not* suitable for?

A. Time series analysis

B. Unsupervised learning

C. Supervised learning

D. Difference in differences


## How can color be used effectively in a data visualization?

A. To highlight important data points or trends.

B. To make the visualization more visually appealing.

C. To confuse the viewer with too many colors.

D. To distract from the key message of the visualization.



## What are your takeaways from the course?

:::{.incremental}
- Let the business or research question guide your analysis

- Once you have something to say, develop a compelling story

- Support your story with effective and appropriate visualizations
