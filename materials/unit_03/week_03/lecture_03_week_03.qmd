## Project Overview


Choose one of the "treatment" datasets and find an outcome to evaluate

What is the impact of $x$ (treatment or exposure) on some outcome $y$?

Collect panel data and build dataset. Aggregate to the lowest communit unit of analysis (e.g., county year). Merge data.

Perform an exploratory data analysis and assemble summary statistics. Analyze spatial patterns, correlations, etc. Estimate the effect of $x$ on $y$. Build visualizations to answer your research question.

Present results in class on final. Report due Thursday.

## Bats and Ag Land Prices (Manning & Ando)

## Research Question

:::{.incremental}
- What effect do bats have on crop production (e.g., corn and soy beans)?

  - No good measure of bats, but we know white nose syndrome kills bats

- What effect does white nose syndrome have on production, and land values?
:::

## What data would you collect?

iclicker short answer

:::{.incremental}
- Outcomes: cash rents, cropland acres

- Treatment: presence of white nose syndrome

- Controls: population, land quality, weather

- Unit of observation: county-year
:::

## How would you specify the regression model?

Think about it.  I'll pick someone to write it on the board.

:::{.incremental}

- $$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$
