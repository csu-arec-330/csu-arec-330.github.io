<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Good evening. I’m Lauren, a local economic analyst.</p>
<p>We’re here today because the community needs to consider adding a new access road to Highway 101.</p>
<p>There is room in the town’s budget for infrastructure improvements, but there is a concern that developing new roads might lead to higher fuel costs.</p>
<p>Tonight, I’ll present to you analysis my team and I conducted on how gas prices vary with distance to the highway.</p>
<p><strong>Decision Needed:</strong> To better understand the trade-offs involved with improving highway access so that you, the town planning committee, can decide to add a new access road.</p>
</section>
<section id="question" class="slide level2 larger">
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>How does the distance to the nearest highway relate to the price of gas paid by consumers?</p>
</section>
<section id="why-does-it-matter" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
<p>As we consider building a new access road to Highway 101, it’s important to understand the broader implications for our community—especially how it might affect gas prices.</p>
<p>If gas stations located closer to highway access charge more, then adding a new access point could inadvertently <strong>raise fuel costs</strong> for residents.</p>
<p>This analysis helps us weigh the <strong>potential economic benefit to consumers</strong> against the <strong>infrastructure costs</strong>, giving the town planning committee better information to guide your decision.</p>

<section id="analysis-plan" class="slide level2 scrollable">
<h2>Analysis Plan</h2>
<p>In order to answer our question: <strong>How does the distance to the nearest highway relate to the price of gas paid by consumers?</strong> we need data on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Location of gas stations (unit of analysis)</p></li>
<li><p>Price of gas (outcome variable)</p></li>
<li><p>Distance between gas station and the nearest highway (variable of interest)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These will serve as inputs into my linear regression model.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Location of gas stations (<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>)</li>

<li>We gathered data on U.S. convenience stores with gas stations (<code>store_info</code>)</li>

<li>Price of gas (<span class="math inline">\(pr_i\)</span>)</li>

<p>Although our model fit improved (1.7%), the p-value associated with the number of gas stations within 5 km is not statistically significant, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is different from zero.</p>
<p>However, the coefficient on distance (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>) remains statistically significant, suggesting the results are robust.</p>

</section>
<section id="takeaways" class="slide level2">
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>Our analysis shows consistent results between distance and unit price-each kilometer away from the highway corresponds with a decrease in gas prices.</p>
<p>Adding a control variable that attempts to capture competition (number of gas stations within 5 km) does not explain variation in unit prices.</p>
</section>
<section id="assumptions-and-limitations" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We assume that a gas station will locate along the new highway access road (once it is built) near the highway to attract traffic flow from Highway 101.</p></li>
<li><p>We assume that gas stations compete uniformly along prices of their grades of gasoline.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We use distance “as the crow flies” versus travel distance along the road.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not account for other confounding factors that could influence gas prices, such as the traffic flow on Highway 101 nearest to the town and distance to the nearest major metropolitan area.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="discussion" class="slide level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The pattern we observe (inverse relationship between distance and price) suggests that stations closer to the highway charge a premium for the convenience of being located near the highway.</p>
<p>For those commuting to work places outside of town, this might mean higher travel expenses.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our analysis confirms that distance from the highway is a factor related to gas prices in our community.</p>
<p>However, the considering the current travel cost to the highway without the access road, offsets the modest expected increase in gas prices.</p>
</section>
<section id="as-you-prepare-to-vote-tonight" class="slide level2">
<h2>As you prepare to vote tonight</h2>
<p>Consider that building the access road could offer long-term savings for many households, even if prices near the highway remain slightly elevated.</p>
<p>Possible ways to balance these outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize carpooling or shuttle programs to reduce fuel usage.</li>

## Bats and Ag Land Prices ([Manning & Ando](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/720303))

![](includes/09-bats-1024x659.jpeg)

## Research Question

:::{.incremental}
- What effect do bats have on crop production (e.g., corn and soy beans)?

  - No good measure of bats, but we know white nose syndrome (WNS) kills bats
  
  - WNS is monitored by county over time

- What effect does white nose syndrome have on production, and land values?
:::

## What data would you collect?

iclicker short answer

:::{.incremental}
- Outcomes: cash rents, cropland acres

- Treatment: presence of white nose syndrome

- Controls: population, land quality, weather

- Unit of observation: county-year
:::

## How would you specify the regression model?

Think about it.  I'll pick someone to write it on the board.

:::{.incremental}

- $$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$
:::

## Which coefficient answers the research question?

$$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$

A. $\beta$

B. $\gamma$

C. $\delta_t$

D. $\alpha_i$

## What is the role of $\alpha_i$ in the regression?

$$ y_{it} = \beta \cdot WNS_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$

A. To capture the average treatment effect of white nose syndrome on ag land prices

B. To capture unobserved factors in a county that do not vary over time

C. To capture unobserved factors common to all counties at a given point in time

D. To control for federal agricultural policies that may change over time

# Results

## What is the effect of WNS on land rents?

<!-- ## What is the purpose of decomposing a time series into its components? -->
<!-- A. To remove any anomalies or outliers from the data. -->
<!-- B. To prepare the data for regression analysis. -->
<!-- C. To determine the forecast accuracy of the time series. -->
<!-- D. To identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. -->
<!-- Answer D

Explanation: Decomposing a time series into its components is primarily done to understand and identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, including trends, seasonal variations, and irregular components. This process allows analysts to better understand the time series dynamics and can aid in improving forecasting models by clarifying what influences the data's movements over time.

-->
<!-- ## When is clustering analysis an appropriate technique for data analysis? -->
<!-- A. When the data is unlabeled or unstructured. -->
<!-- B. When the data has a clear target variable or outcome. -->
<!-- C. When the data has a linear relationship between variables. -->
<!-- D. When the data is in a time series format. -->
<!-- Answer A

Explanation: Clustering analysis is particularly suitable when you are dealing with unlabeled or unstructured data, as it helps to identify inherent groupings or patterns within the data without any prior labels. This technique is used to explore data and discover natural segments, groups, or classes by analyzing the structure based solely on the properties of the data.

-->
<!-- ## Which of the following analysis techniques is regression *not* suitable for? -->
<!-- A. Predicting a continuous outcome based on multiple input variables. -->
<!-- B. Estimating the effect of price changes on sales volume. -->
<!-- C. Analyzing the relationship between temperature and energy consumption. -->
<!-- D. Identifying distinct clusters of customers based on shopping behavior. -->
<!-- Answer: D 

Explanation: Regression analysis is used to model and predict continuous outcomes, estimate effects, and analyze relationships between variables. It is not suitable for identifying clusters, which is a task for cluster analysis techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering that are designed to detect patterns and groupings in data.

-->
<!-- ## How can color be used effectively in a data visualization? -->
<!-- A. To highlight important data points or trends. -->
<!-- B. To make the visualization more visually appealing. -->
<!-- C. To confuse the viewer with too many colors. -->
<!-- D. To distract from the key message of the visualization. -->
