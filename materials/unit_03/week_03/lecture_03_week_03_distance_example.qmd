## [Project Overview](project_3.html) {.scrollable}

**The Question:** Your question for Project 3 should be formulated as: What is the association between $x$ (an explanatory variable) and $y$ (some outcome)?

**The Data:** You will use the convenience store data (shopper_info, store_info, gtin) to select your $y$, and choose **one** of the two additional datasets (census data or weather data) to choose your $x$.
 
- **Option 1:** Convenience store data combined with Demographic data from the US Census

- **Option 2:** Convenience store data combined with Weather data from NOAA

## How to succeed for Project 3

# Understanding Gas Prices in Our Community: <br>A Town Hall Discussion

## Introduction {.smaller}

Good evening. I'm Lauren, a local economic analyst.

We're here today because the community needs to consider adding a new access road to Highway 101.

There is room in the town's budget for infrastructure improvements, but there is a concern that developing new roads might lead to higher fuel costs.

Tonight, I'll present to you analysis my team and I conducted on how gas prices vary with distance to the highway. 

**Goal:** To better understand the trade-offs involved with improving highway access so that you, the town planning committee, can decide to add a new access road.


## The Question

**How does the distance to the nearest highway relate to the price of gas paid by consumers?**

Understanding this relationship can help predict expected costs to consumers and manage the town's budget more effectively.


## Background {.scrollable}

Concerns about re-routing the highway: 

- Could create more traffic for the town

- Could lead to an increase in gas prices (gas stations could charge a higher price due to proximity to the highway)


Benefits about re-routing the highway:

- Shorter commuting time for residents

- Better-conditioned road which offers ancillary benefits 

- More tax revenue from more gas sales


## Data Collection {.scrollable}

We gathered data from U.S. convenience stores with gas stations. 

We calculated their distance to the nearest highway and removed stores located further than 40 kilometers away. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Load necessary packages
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, modelsummary, sf, progress, GGally, knitr, readr)

# Read in the transaction level data
shopper_info <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_03/inputs/shopper_info.csv.gz")

# Read in store distance data
store_dist <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_03/inputs/store_dist.csv")

# read in convenience store location dataset
store_raw <- read_csv("https://csu-arec-330.github.io/materials/unit_03/inputs/store_info.csv.gz")

# Function to classify fuel and not fuel based on descriptions
classify_fuel <- function(description) {
  # Check if the description is not NA and is a character
  if (!is.na(description) && is.character(description)) {
    # Convert description to lower case for case-insensitivity
    description_lower <- tolower(description)
    
    # Define keywords associated with fuel
    fuel_keywords <- c("unld","unlead", "unleaded", "regular", "mid", "premium", "diesel", 
                       "gas", "ethanol", "e85", "fuel", "octane", "ultra", "prem","super")
    
    # Check for the presence of fuel-related keywords or a number in the description
    if (any(sapply(fuel_keywords, grepl, x = description_lower)) || grepl("[0-9]", description_lower)) {
      return("fuel")
    } else {
      return("not fuel")
    }
  } else {
    return("not fuel")
  }
}

store_gas <- shopper_info %>%
  filter(is.na(gtin)) %>%
  mutate(gas = sapply(pos_description, classify_fuel)) %>% #classify all observations as fuel or not
  filter(gas=="fuel") %>% #remove non-fuel observations
  group_by(store_id) %>% 
  summarise(unit_price=mean(unit_price,na.rm = T)) %>% #calculate the average price of fuel items sold at the location
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(between(unit_price,2.5,5)) #based on a distribution of the data, remove fuel prices less than $2.50 and above $5.00

#join the store-level fuel price back to the raw store dataset to attach the coordinates
store_gas_geo <- inner_join(store_gas,select(store_raw,store_id,latitude,longitude,zip_code),by="store_id") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords=c("longitude","latitude"),crs=st_crs(4326))

#Calculate the number of stores within 10km of each other

store_geo_m <- store_gas_geo %>%
  st_transform(5070)

# Calculate the matrix of distances between all stores
distance_matrix <- st_distance(store_geo_m)

# Count stores within 5 km for each store
# 5000 meters is equivalent to 5 kilometers
stores_within_5km <- apply(distance_matrix, 1, function(distances) sum(distances <= 5000, na.rm = TRUE) - 1)

# Add this count as a new column to the sf object
stores_within <- store_gas %>%
  mutate(count_within = stores_within_5km)


#Load all US primary roads - downloaded from https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2021&layergroup=Roads
us_roads <- st_read("tl_2022_us_primaryroads/tl_2022_us_primaryroads.shp") %>%
  st_transform(4326)

#testing
Litchfield_County <- store_gas_geo %>%
  arrange(zip_code) %>%
  filter(zip_code == "06790") %>%
  head(5)

#Find nearest primary road
nd <- st_nearest_feature(Litchfield_County,us_roads)

#Calculate distance from store to nearest primary road
Litchfield_County <- mutate(Litchfield_County,dist=as.numeric(st_distance(Litchfield_County,us_roads[nd,],by_element = T))/1000)

library(mapview)
mapview(Litchfield_County,col.region="red") + mapview(us_roads[nd,],col.region="blue")
```


## Summary Statistics

Below is a summary table of average prices per gallon and distances from the nearest highway for our sample of gas stations.

## Distribution of Unit Price and Distance

Figure 1: Matrix of density plots for unit price and distance
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Filter dataset to keep only stores within 40 km of a major road
store_dist_40 <- store_dist %>%
  filter(dist < 40) %>%
  inner_join(select(stores_within,-unit_price),by="store_id")

ggpairs(store_dist_40, columns = 2:3)

```

## Unit prices appear to decrease as distance to highway increases

Figure 2: Scatter plot of unit price and distance
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Scatter plot of unit prices and distance
ggplot(store_dist_40, aes(x = dist, y = unit_price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Univariate Regression Analysis {.smaller}

Although we can draw loose insights from the scatter plot, we use regression analysis to determine the relationship between distance and price. 

$$ pr_{i} = \beta \cdot Dist_{i} + \alpha + \varepsilon_{i} $$

- Outcome: price per gallon

- Explanatory variable: distance to the highway (in kilometers)

- Unit of observation: convenience stores with gas pumps

## Univariate Regression Results {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Estimate linear regression of unit_price on distance
reg1 <- lm(unit_price ~ dist, data = store_dist_40) 

# Extract model results
results_df <- broom::tidy(reg1, conf.int = TRUE)

# Convert results to wide format if necessary or customize the table manually
kable(results_df, format = "html", caption = "Table 2: Regression Results for Unit Price vs. Distance")

```

Our analysis shows a clear trendâ€”each kilometer away from the highway corresponds with a decrease in gas prices.

## For each additional km away from the highway, unit prices decrease by $0.005 cents per gallon

Figure 3: Scatter plot of unit price and distance, with line of best fit
```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(store_dist_40, aes(x = dist, y = unit_price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Distance and Unit Price",
       x = "Distance from Highway (km)",
       y = "Unit Price (cents per gallon)") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Multivariate Regression Analysis {.smaller}

After adding additional control variables, we want to test if our results still hold.

$$ pr_{i} = \beta_1 \cdot Dist_{i} + \beta_2 \cdot X_{i} + \alpha + \varepsilon_{i} $$

- Outcome: price per gallon

- Explanatory variable: distance to the highway (in kilometers)

- Controls: number of gas stations within 5 kilometers

- Unit of observation: convenience stores with gas pumps


## Multivariate Regression Results {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Estimate linear regression of unit_price on distance
reg2 <- lm(unit_price ~ dist + count_within, data = store_dist_40) 

# Extract model results
results_df <- broom::tidy(reg2, conf.int = TRUE)

# Convert results to wide format if necessary or customize the table manually
kable(results_df, format = "html", caption = "Table 3: Regression Results for Unit Price vs. Distance and Number of Competitors")

```

The p-value associated with the number of gas stations within 5 km is not statistically significant, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is different from zero.


## Takeaways

Our analysis shows consistent results between distance and unit price-each kilometer away from the highway corresponds with a decrease in gas prices.

Adding a control variable that attempts to capture competition (number of gas stations within 5 km) does not explain variation in unit prices.


## Assumptions and Limitations {.smaller}

Assumptions:

- We assume that a gas station will locate along the new highway access road (once it is built) near the highway to attract traffic flow from Highway 101.

- We assume that gas stations compete uniformly along prices of their grades of gasoline.


Limitations:

- We use distance "as the crow flies" versus travel distance along the road.

- We do not account for other confounding factors that could influence gas prices, such as the traffic flow on Highway 101 nearest to the town and distance to the nearest major metropolitan area.


## Discussion

The pattern we observe (inverse relationship between distance and price) suggests that stations closer to the highway charge a premium for the convenience of being located near the highway.

<!--can offer lower prices due to higher traffic and potentially lower transportation costs.-->

For those commuting to work places outside of town, this might mean higher travel expenses.


## Conclusion

Our analysis confirms that distance from the highway is a key factor affecting gas prices in our community.

However, the considering the current travel cost to the highway without the access road, offsets the modest expected increase in gas prices.

Possible solutions: 

- Organize carpooling options 

- Support local gas stations with loyalty programs

# Course Review

## What was this course about?

## Topics and themes

- Effective and appropriate data visualizations

- Data storytelling

- Scripted data management and analysis (in R)


## Organization

- Time series

- Cross sectional and spatial data

- Regression analysis 

What methods did we cover in these areas?



## What is the purpose of decomposing a time series into its components?

A. To remove any anomalies or outliers from the data.

B. To prepare the data for regression analysis.

C. To determine the forecast accuracy of the time series.

D. To identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

<!-- Answer D

Explanation: Decomposing a time series into its components is primarily done to understand and identify the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, including trends, seasonal variations, and irregular components. This process allows analysts to better understand the time series dynamics and can aid in improving forecasting models by clarifying what influences the data's movements over time.

-->

## When is clustering analysis an appropriate technique for data analysis?

A. When the data is unlabeled or unstructured.

B. When the data has a clear target variable or outcome.

C. When the data has a linear relationship between variables.

D. When the data is in a time series format.

<!-- Answer A

Explanation: Clustering analysis is particularly suitable when you are dealing with unlabeled or unstructured data, as it helps to identify inherent groupings or patterns within the data without any prior labels. This technique is used to explore data and discover natural segments, groups, or classes by analyzing the structure based solely on the properties of the data.

-->


## Which of the following analysis techniques is regression *not* suitable for?

A. Predicting a continuous outcome based on multiple input variables.

B. Estimating the effect of price changes on sales volume.

C. Analyzing the relationship between temperature and energy consumption.

D. Identifying distinct clusters of customers based on shopping behavior.

<!-- Answer: D 

Explanation: Regression analysis is used to model and predict continuous outcomes, estimate effects, and analyze relationships between variables. It is not suitable for identifying clusters, which is a task for cluster analysis techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering that are designed to detect patterns and groupings in data.

-->

## How can color be used effectively in a data visualization?

A. To highlight important data points or trends.

B. To make the visualization more visually appealing.

C. To confuse the viewer with too many colors.

D. To distract from the key message of the visualization.
