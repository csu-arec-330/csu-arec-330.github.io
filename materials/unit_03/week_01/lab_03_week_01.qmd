- Estimate the marginal effect of an exposure (pollution) on an outcome using fixed-effects regression


# R

Panel data is a type of longitudinal data that involves the collection of observations on the same individuals or units over time. This makes panel data different from cross-sectional data, which involves the collection of observations on different individuals or units at a single point in time, and time series data, which involves the collection of observations on the same variable over time.
