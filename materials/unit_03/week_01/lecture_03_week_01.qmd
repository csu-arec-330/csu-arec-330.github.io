## What is spatial data? 

Data about a point or area defined in space

:::: {.columns style="text-align: left"}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Vector Data 

- Point (e.g., locations of stores, geotagged tweets)

- Line Data (e.g., roads, rivers)

- Polygon Data (e.g., boundaries of countries, lakes)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Raster Data 

- Grid/raster data is reported in a uniformly sized grid over some area (e.g., satellite images)

## Common Sources of Spatial Data

- Public datasets (e.g., [USGS](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/), [NASA](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/usfs/map/#d:24hrs;@-103.2,40.1,5.4z))

- Private sources (e.g., [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5753329,-105.0908151,15z?entry=ttu))

- Crowdsourced data (e.g., [PurpleAir](https://map.purpleair.com/1/mAQI/a10/p604800/cC0#10.56/40.5138/-105.0647))


# Understanding Spatial Relationships

## Other examples of panel data

Individuals' health status over time

Individuals' wages over time

Counties' precipitation over time

Others?

## Clicker question

What is panel data?

A. Data collected on different individuals or units at a single point in time

B. Data collected on the same individuals or units over time

C. Data collected on the same variable over time

D. Data collected on different variables at a single point in time

## Panel data and the case for causality

Causal inference is the gold standard in economics research

We want to know the causal effect of a policy or intervention on people or some outcome

How does an increase in the minimum wage impact youth employment?

How might you answer that question? 

What does economic theory say?

## Time series perspective: youth employment in Benton Co, MN
:::: {.columns style="text-align: left"}

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](includes/did_ts.png)

::: 

::: {.column width="50%"}
What happens to youth employment after 2006?

Can you conclude that an increase in the minimum wage reduces employment?
:::

## Cross section perspective : youth employment in 2007

:::: {.columns style="text-align: left"}

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](includes/did_cs.png)

::: 

::: {.column width="50%"}
What happens to youth employment in the treated counties?

Can you conclude that an increase in the minimum wage increases employment?

## Benefits of panel data

:::: {.columns style="text-align: left"}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Panel data measures units over time

This allows us to statistically compare those that experience the policy to those that do not

## Analyzing Panel Data

Analyzing panel data typically involves comparing a person or unit to themselves at different points in time

Comparing a unit to themselves removes all characteristics of that unit that do not vary over time but may influence the outcome$^{*}$ 

In regression, we remove (or control for) these characteristics with fixed effects

We can use regression to compare units before and after some change or policy



# The experimental ideal {background-image=includes/ucd_experiment.jpg}

## Approximating the experimental ideal

We cannot usually conduct our own experiments (though many in economics are now)

We can look for opportunities where policy or nature create experiments (sugar rationing)

Where some group of units is exposed to a policy or event (treated)

The key is that treatment assignment is approximately random


## Analyzing exposure

In many cases, people or units are exposed to varying levels of something (e.g., pollution, heat)

We can use regression to assess the incremental impact of the exposure

Panel data enables comparison of units with a given exposure to themselves at different levels of exposure controlling for a unit's characteristics 

## Difference in differences

DiD is a popular method for exploiting panel data because it is simple and intuitive

The method compares the difference between the change in some outcome in the treatment and control units

Returning to our min wage example, we want to compare the change in employment (before to after policy) in the treatment unit to the control unit.

## Potential problems with observational data

Observational data is collected on the state of the world that is, and not on what could have been

Our challenge is to estimate what could have been (the counterfactual)

- omitted variables can bias estimates

- measurement error in independent variables can bias estimates

- simultaneity or reverse causality can bias estimates

- selection on unobserved information

## Summary

Panel data measures units over time

Panel data permits causal research designs

Causal techniques try to get us back to the experimental ideal

Be aware of possiblem problems in the research design

## Project 2: Overview

Form groups of 2 (THIS WEEK)

Choose one of the "treatment" datasets and find an outcome to evaluate

What is the impact of $x$ on some outcome $y$

Collect panel data and build dataset (talk to Jude and Ali early if you need help)

Perform an exploratory data analysis and assemble summary statistics; analyze spatial patterns, correlations, etc.; and construct visualizations to answer your research question.

Present results in class on final.
