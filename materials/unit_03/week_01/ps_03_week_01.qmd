## Problem Set Overview

This problem set is intended to get you started on your third project for the course. 

### The Question & The Data

Your question for project 3 should be in the form of: What is the association between $x$ (an explanatory variable) and $y$ (some outcome)? For this project, you will use the convenience store data (shopper_info, store_info, gtin) to select your $y$, and choose **one** of the two additional datasets (census data or weather data) to choose your $x$.

- Option 1: Convenience store data and Demographic data from the US Census

- Option 2: Convenience store data and Weather data from NOAA

### Building your panel dataset

Once you have the question in mind, you need to build the dataset. Building the dataset may look different depending on your question and the regression model you intend to estimate. For this problem set, you will practice building datasets using both the Census data and the weather data.

#### Part 1: Using Census data
1. In the lab, we loaded median income from the American Community Survey (ACS) Census data. For your problem set, find the table associated population density. Then, create a new spatial dataframe that joins population density to the geocoded store data. Only include the data for the 48 contiguous US states.

2. Generate a map in R that plots county-level population density using mapview. Note: You will have to manipulate the data using `group_by()` and `summarize()`.

#### Part 2: Using weather data

1. Following the instructions from the lab, read in the shopper info data and the weather data. Join the two dataframes and create a panel dataset.

2. Group the merged dataset by county and calculate the average monthly rainfall for each county. Then, generate a map in R that plots county-level average rainfall using mapview. Only include the data for the 48 contiguous US states.

### Project 3

1. Who are your Project 3 team members?

2. What is the relationship you want to examine? (Indicate whether you are selecting Option 1 or Option 2, described above.)

## How to Submit

You should create a new webpage on your Google site titled `Project 3 Problem Set 1`. Your webpage should include the code you used to generate the two maps, the two maps themselves, and response to the questions, where pertinent. Submit the link to your Google site webpage in Canvas. You should work on building your own webpage, but only one member of the group needs to submit the link.
